review/summary: Great charger
review/text: I recently bought this charger kit from Amazon and I am quite happy with my purchase. The folding plug is nice for storage. The included 1850 mAh batteries last for a long time in my Nikon Coolpix 2100. One of the best features of the charger is that each battery is charged separately (as opposed to in pairs) so that each battery gets just the right amount of charge. The short 3 hour charge time is great as well. The batteries do not get overly warm while charging either.Overall, this is a good charger for a good price. If you have a high drain device, the Kodak K2000 should keep you playing for a long time.

review/summary: Super product! I'm very happy.
review/text: The batteries are excellent (1850's), and the charger is super fast, and stops charging when done. I love that you just plug the unit right into the wall with no unruly cords. My Sony digital only takes 2 AA batteries, so with this charger, I always have two sets of spare batteries with me in my case. This charger even charges up my SONY AA batteries that came with the camera.Highly recommended!

review/summary: Problem with charging smaller AAAs
review/text: I have had the charger for more than two years. It charges AA batteries just fine, but has a huge problem securing smaller AAA batteries. To charge the smaller batteries you need to flip down the little button at the positive end. In the beginning one of the four AAA batteries would pop up, and now three out of the four won't hold. The problem is the flip mechanism became loose, and any horizontal pressure would push the buttons back up. What I have to do now is using duct tape and a segment of crayon, apply the crayon on the buttons, and wrap the tape around. You know how painful that is.

review/summary: CHECK OUT THE K6000 CHARGER!
review/text: Greetings. Kodak also has a K6000 charger which comes with 4 NiMH 2100 mAh batteries. Two batteries charge is 64 minutes and 4 batteries charge in 140 minutes. The problem is that Amazon doesn't carry them YET. Good bye.

review/summary: Finally a Great recharger with batteries!
review/text: I have used and recharged my batteries nearly 100 times already and it shows no sign of giving out. Perfect for remote controls or other battery "hungry" devices, but they work just like normal batteries as far as life span is concerned. I would recommend this product to anyone!

review/summary: Works, but not as advertised
review/text: I bought one of these chargers..the instructions say the lights stay on while the battery charges...true. The instructions doNT say the lights turn off when its done. Which is also true. 24 hours of charging and the lights stay on. I returned it thinking I had a bad unit.The new one did the same thing. I just kept it since it does charge...but the lights are useless since they seem to always stay on. It's a "backup" charger for when I manage to drain all my AAs but I wouldn't want this as my only charger.

review/summary: Great for the non-audiophile
review/text: Reviewed quite a bit of the combo players and was hesitant due to unfavorable reviews and size of machines. I am weaning off my VHS collection, but don't want to replace them with DVD's. This unit is well built, easy to setup and resolution and special effects (no progressive scan for HDTV owners) suitable for many people looking for a versatile product.Cons- No universal remote.

review/summary: Excellent choice for combination
review/text: After reading several reviews on this item, I purchased it as a Christmas gift. My brother liked it a lot, so I decided to get one for my wife and me. I'm really glad I did. It's pretty easy to set up and use, and the playback is excellent in both the VCR and DVD modes. The remote also operates my JVC TV. This is a great choice if you're looking for a quality combination player from a trusted name in electronics.

review/summary: Does what it says it will
review/text: This is a nice combo DVD/VCR. I've had it for a couple of years now and have had no problems. That's really why I'm writing; I want to let people know the ones with problems are probably the exception rather than the rule.The only disadvantages to this product for me:1) On the VCR, you can't FF by time (a panasonic feature; FF a given number of minutes)2) Once you set the VCR program, you must hit TIMER (not just power off) to get it to use the program. Okay, hitting TIMER will turn the power off, but let's say you want to record something later in the week. You will turn your deck on and off several times in that period. Do you want to hit TIMER every time? And by the way, hitting TIMER doesn't just turn the deck off, it switches to DVD mode. In theory, this is nice so you can still use your DVD player while recording a show. In practice you just end up turning off two things (VCR via TIMER, DVD via power) most of the time.3) No S-video input. I had to buy a S-video to composite video adapter to record something from my PC video card. By the way, don't do this; the quality is pretty low.Little advantages to this product for me:1) Front panel inputs; I use this to dub from my video camera very often2) Comprehensive remote; for me, the more buttons the better. I hate on-screen menus. How can I see what the picture looks like when I adjust the tracking if 88% of the screen is the tracking menu?3) Many flavors of A/V OUTPUT: digital audio (coax and optical), composite video (of course), component video (nice for home theater), S video.Bottom line: A good combo deck for the money.

review/summary: Based on the reviews here I bought one and I'm glad I did!
review/text: This VCR/DVD was an early Christmas present to myself after deciding to join the rest of the world in DVD-land but not wanting to let go of my VHS movies quite yet. Based on the reviews and price, and because I own a JVC TV, this was my choice. I agree with the easy set-up. It's a bit awkward to work the whole TV/VHS/DVD selection options but I think I've gotten the hang of it.Two comments: it's not intuitive and actually is pretty complicated (too many buttons on the remote but that might please others who are more technically-minded than me) so I've had to rely heavily on the how-to manual. And setting the VCR timer is awkward -- you can't enter the start and end time but have to scroll (unless I'm missing something)...but those are my only complaints. This is a good product for your $$$.

review/summary: Great Combo Package!
review/text: I decided to wait over a year to write a review on this unit, and thankfully my opinion since the first day I got it hasn't changed. It's wonderful! I was suprised to find a full feature DVD player included. A friend of mine bought a relatively expensive DVD player and it didn't have some of the features this unit has (albeit its a bit smaller). I have never experienced performance issues while using the DVD player in 12+ months. Zoom feature comes in handy as well, if you rent DVDs and don't necessarily want the whole long apect ratio. VCR works great as well. Recordings done in SP look excellent, colors are great and its not grainy at all. EP recordings look great for being EP as well, if you sit back on the couch you can't tell the difference. Only problem there is sometimes it takes a few seconds to track with EP, but it normally finds the right setting fairly quickly. The remote is easy to use once you learn it. It can be confusing at first, but now I wouldn't use anything else. It can control all the TV functions as well at the combo unit. If you want to take a small step into the world of DVD players, but not let go of your old VHS tapes, this is the player for you. Especially now, with the price quite reduced from when I bought it. You will not be disappointed!

review/summary: It started out fine, but....
review/text: I've had this for just over a month. I had read other reviews on this product prior to purchasing, and to me it seemed like it had received good reviews as simple-to-use machine with good attribues for not-so-electronic-literate person like myself. It had been working just fine, until few days ago I was playing a DVD and all of a sudden it would freeze, and on the TV screen there would be many different colored squares, completely distorting the image. And now, the Dvd player does not even recognize any format (I've tried CDs, DVDs, and even VCDs), as it only says &quot;Incorrect Disc&quot;.I just now found another review where the person had the same problem, had to take it to a local service center, got fixed, came back, and the exact same problem popped back up three weeks later.Reading that, I don't even know if I want to even bother taking it to get it fixed. Since it still plays VHS perfectly fine, maybe I'll just invest in a simple DVD player, which defeats the whole purpose of why I bought a DVD/VHS combo player in the first place....
