I have many power banks already but I will tell you why I like this power bank. This thing came in a brown recycled box, no fancy packaging, just a simple brown box. The Aibocn (I don't know how would you pronounce this) 5000 is one of the most ergonomic in design. The shape and size really feels good in my hand. It is not heavy which just makes it perfect to carry every day in your purse. At 5,000 mAh, this is enough to fully charge my iPhone6 at least twice.

It has a 2.4A and a 1.0A output which can charge two devices simultaneously. The labels are very easy to discern, 1 lightning icon for 1.0A and two lightning icons for the 2.4A. If you press the button on the side, the blue LEDs will light up to indicate how much juice is left in the power bank. The more LEDs and the more powerful the light is, the more juice you still have remaining. If the LEDs start blinking then that tells you that the power bank is almost empty and needs to be plug for recharging.

Simple, sleek. Reminds me of classic iPod in size. Easy to slip into laptop bag and should give me a couple charges on my phone or keep it going on days when I forget to charge it up overnight. Simple, no on, off, no buttons to get pushed in your pocket or bag. Just plug in device. Has 4 lite indicator showing capacity remaining and has simple USBcharger cord included. It works on my iPhone 6. No complaints.
I have a 15000mAh Anker that's the same size but 3x as thick with a flashlight. This unit will replace the old one. 15000 could keep my phone going for a week and for a device that I use infrequently I'd prefer it to be lighter and do what I need. The Anker is nice but it's a brick. This has a good price for what you get, simple product with less features to fail. I might pick up an extra and hide it my wife's purse.
