I recently bought this charger kit from Amazon and I am quite happy with my purchase .
I would recommend this product to anyone ! .
These will more than pay for themselves , they are perfect for my GPS which will drain a cheap battery in less than an hour.btw the charger did come with 1850 batteries . .
The recharging process is less than 3 hours .
So once you calculate that these can be charged 800 times , they are a MUCH better deal than buying normal batteries all the time .

Hit q or quit to leave. Enter product ID: Reviewed quite a bit of the combo players and was hesitant due to unfavorable reviews and size of machines .
You will not be disappointed ! .
I have had this for about 10 years and nothing has happened to it and still works like a charm !
Making two units into one may save on some costs , but the cost cutting may be the use of cheaper parts inside .
I own two JVC S-VHS recorders with flying erase heads .

Hit q or quit to leave. Enter product ID: My experience : I got this from FM , not Amazon .
I was shocked and horrified to realize that this hideous remote had no `` last channel '' button .
We hope you accept our apologies for the inconvenience you have experienced with our product .
I returned it and got a repalcement , which once again the DVD player failed to work !
The stand is awesome and you have the option to wall mount it .

Hit q or quit to leave. Enter product ID: I am fairly satisfied with the MusixStation .
After that , it sounds like garbage .
To me that is an obstacle , I want to select things quickly .
A Loudness button you select On or Off .
There 's just an AUX in jack that you could hook up your laptop , MP3 players , what-not .

Hit q or quit to leave. Enter product ID: The tripod is well built .
It can be hard to get smooth pans without some jerkiness.However , the overall features and utility of the remote handle and a reasonable price , make this a good buy . .
At times it seems a little too flimsy , but it hold my Sony HDR-FX1 and my Canon XH-A1 prosumer camcoders.I had a special training I needed to record and place on DVD .
I had a Vivitar tripod but it is not worthy and decided to stick to Sony -LRB- I own a TRV-70 Sony camcorder and I am buying a Sony digital camera Cybershot DSCH1 also from Amazon -RRB- .
I used this for taping while we were opening gifts for christmas .

Hit q or quit to leave. Enter product ID: I have used many video cameras in my life , but I have never owned one until now .
On the other hand , if you do n't shoot a lot of videos and want something cheap , the Hi8 is still a good way to go .
This is definitely as great buy ! .
It allows me to make movies for friends and family without having to deal with a whole lot of buttons and distractions .
After finding the manual on-line , I saw where the capstan went.I know I would n't have been able to fix my original camera if I had n't purchased my new cameral through Amazon .

Hit q or quit to leave. Enter product ID: Perfect carry-along for my notebook PC .
When the apartment building next to mine was struck by lightning , I decided that I better get a surge protector and this portable option was just what I wanted . .
Not so with this little gem .
I 've got 'em on lots of electronics -LRB- printers , phones , laptops -RRB- that do n't need a full power strip or universal power supply -LRB- UPS -RRB- .
Lights illuminate to show you that the system is working .

Hit q or quit to leave. Enter product ID: Hi.I got this camcorder few days before , and now using it daily almost 5 hours in day .
Even still shots , are n't that clear .
The size of the camera is a little big .
The more money you put into a product ... THE BETTER .
While this is a decent Analog camcorder , do n't expect much from the USB streaming feature .

Hit q or quit to leave. Enter product ID: I recently purchased this camera and have been very pleased with its performance .
-LRB- Do n't be impressd by the 460X digital zoom -- on any camcorder ; the image becomes more blurry the closer you zoom in with it . -RRB-
This camera is great .
Price and function are two of the main reasons I now own this camcorder .
I always use them with a SIMA infrared light which fits nicely on this camera due to its larger size .

Hit q or quit to leave. Enter product ID: Does just what was needed to charge the Macbook Pro G4 13inch laptop .
So far it works great .
This is n't apparent unless you are using it while plugged in , but the battery icon will show it is charging for a couple of seconds , then flip back to the battery icon for a couple of seconds and so on .
Spend a little more and get something better if you can . .
Its $ 50 less than the Apple one so go buy it . .
