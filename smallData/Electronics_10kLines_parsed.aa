Kodak Max K2000 Battery Charger with 4 NiMH AA Batteries
I recently bought this charger kit from Amazon and I am quite happy with my purchase. The folding plug is nice for storage. The included 1850 mAh batteries last for a long time in my Nikon Coolpix 2100. One of the best features of the charger is that each battery is charged separately (as opposed to in pairs) so that each battery gets just the right amount of charge. The short 3 hour charge time is great as well. The batteries do not get overly warm while charging either.Overall, this is a good charger for a good price. If you have a high drain device, the Kodak K2000 should keep you playing for a long time.

The batteries are excellent (1850's), and the charger is super fast, and stops charging when done. I love that you just plug the unit right into the wall with no unruly cords. My Sony digital only takes 2 AA batteries, so with this charger, I always have two sets of spare batteries with me in my case. This charger even charges up my SONY AA batteries that came with the camera.Highly recommended!

I have had the charger for more than two years. It charges AA batteries just fine, but has a huge problem securing smaller AAA batteries. To charge the smaller batteries you need to flip down the little button at the positive end. In the beginning one of the four AAA batteries would pop up, and now three out of the four won't hold. The problem is the flip mechanism became loose, and any horizontal pressure would push the buttons back up. What I have to do now is using duct tape and a segment of crayon, apply the crayon on the buttons, and wrap the tape around. You know how painful that is.

Greetings. Kodak also has a K6000 charger which comes with 4 NiMH 2100 mAh batteries. Two batteries charge is 64 minutes and 4 batteries charge in 140 minutes. The problem is that Amazon doesn't carry them YET. Good bye.

I have used and recharged my batteries nearly 100 times already and it shows no sign of giving out. Perfect for remote controls or other battery "hungry" devices, but they work just like normal batteries as far as life span is concerned. I would recommend this product to anyone!

I bought one of these chargers..the instructions say the lights stay on while the battery charges...true. The instructions doNT say the lights turn off when its done. Which is also true. 24 hours of charging and the lights stay on. I returned it thinking I had a bad unit.The new one did the same thing. I just kept it since it does charge...but the lights are useless since they seem to always stay on. It's a "backup" charger for when I manage to drain all my AAs but I wouldn't want this as my only charger.

This is simpily the best rechargable batteries I have ever own!But there is a slight issue in which is the reason why I have to return this for something else - different mAh ratings!The charger comes with 1700mAh Batteries!!! Not 1850!!!!!!I purchase this for use in my GPS/GMRS radios (which eats 3 per unit). So natually, I purchase this charger with extra Kodak Max K2000 batteries (same product name, and pretty looks the same in picture) but the problem is that the extra set is rated at 1850! I was planning to use those on my gps, but if the ratings are different, my data between the units might be incorrect.Bottom line, if 4 batteries are all you need, or you can use them in sets of 2 or all 4 at once. GO FOR IT!!! I am a gadget freak and I test many different products frequently. When it comes to batteries - this is it, hands down.

I read the reviews,made my purchase and was very disappointed. The charger is convenient by charging all four batteries at once but the charge only lasts a very short time. I now have to go and find batteries that will give me longer life than the kodak NiMH AA batteries.

I was pleasantly surprised that this charger was so small. The others that I looked at were larger. I also appreciate the fact that this one doesn't have a long cord that has to be curled up when I'm not using it. It takes up much less room in the camera bag. Another plus is that the plug folds under when not in use. That makes the unit even more compact and the plug is less likely to scratch something when stored away.

I bought this charger in Jul 2003 and it worked OK for a while. The design is nice and convenient. However, after about a year, the batteries would not hold a charge. Might as well just get alkaline disposables, or look elsewhere for a charger that comes with batteries that have better staying power.

Kodak Max K2000 Battery Charger with 4 NiMH AA Batteries
I need a fast, compact charger that could easily fit into my digital camera bag. Other chargers are compact, BUT the electric cord takes up a lot of room. This charger DOES NOT have an electric cord to contend with, Instead, it has a collapsable plug, which folds completely hidden into the unit when not in use, allowing it to be placed neatly into the camera bag pocket.With the storage issue taken care of, the performance of this unit is above expectations. The recharging process is less than 3 hours. Unlike other models, you can recharge either one, two three or all four batteries at once and still get a full charge on all batteries. The two battery option is nice for my kids walkie-talkie batteries. The shut down mode when complete is a nice option that is really needed, especially for the time when you forget about the charger until the next morning.I've tried several other chargers and this is the BEST model that I have worked with. Compact, easy storage, fast charging, auto shutdown, charge less than 4 at a time. ALL the options I need for a battery charger.

Kodak Max K2000 Battery Charger with 4 NiMH AA Batteries
The charger makes quick work out of charging all four batteries simultaneously, and automatically shuts off when finished, which is very convenient--no more burned out batteries.Also, the batteries, 1850 mAH, which come with this charger seem to be the highest rated you can buy, and do last very long. Just out of the box, without prior charging, they already outperfomed the Alkalines I had been using previously in my Canon A70. Definately a great buy.One complaint, however, is that the springs that come down to hold smaller AAAs in place break too easily, and will not firmly hold AAAs in place while charging. This has absolutely no affect on Double A batteries, but is an annoyance when trying to charge triple A batteries. It will still charge them, but it's a hassle trying to get the batteries to stay in place when the clip does not hold them sturdily.Overall, a sufficient battery charger. If you are just using it to charge AAs, this is perfect. If you will primarily be charging AAAs, I would look into a different charger, perhaps one that does not involve spring-loading holding mechanisms at all.

Kodak Max K2000 Battery Charger with 4 NiMH AA Batteries
After reading the reviews, I bought this charger. It is everything the positive reviewers are saying. It is simple to use, just fold out the electric prongs and plug into a wall outlet or extension cord. In 3 hours, up to 4 NiMH AA batteries are charged (you can charge 1 to 4 batteries at a time). This charger will shut itself off when it is done charging--in 3 hours. It has lights for each battery telling you when it is charging and the lights go out to let you know that the batteries are fully charged. Since the electric prongs can fold in, the charger can easily fit into a camera bag, or pocket. It is about 2-1/2" by 5" (inches) in dimension. This is an excellent product!!!

I bought this charger to go with my handheld Garmin GPS unit. Once I got this unit, I did some testing using Energizer batteries. I did a full charge of these batteries and they ran as long if not a bit longer than the Energizer batteries. So once you calculate that these can be charged 800 times, they are a MUCH better deal than buying normal batteries all the time. I also bought a 4 pack of the 1850mAh batteries because all the reviews said the charger came with 1700's and the 1850's were that much better. They were wrong, the charger came with 4 1850's so save your[money]on the extra pack.

This battery charger only takes three, yes THREE hours to charge up to 4 AA or AAA batteries. Some of my friends' chargers take 8 hours (overnight) to a full day to charge batteries and they hate it. They paid the same or even more for their chargers too! Switch to this charger and you will never complain. It is one of the fastest chargers and also includes four AA 1700 mAh NiMH batteries which is valued up to $ so this is a great buy. One of the best chargers because it is lightweight, the plug can be folded into the charger, and is super fast!

Kodak Max K2000 Battery Charger with 4 NiMH AA Batteries
I have really enjoyed using these 1850 NiMH Batteries - they last quite a long time in my A70 digital camera and CD player and the charge time is very quick compared to others. Plus, the fact that you can charge each battery individually is very nice, since it prevents overcharging of any battery. Others charge 2 batteries at once and that assumes that both need to charge as long as the other. Also, the charger works well with AA and AAA NiCad and NiMH batteries. Great buy...

I just bought this battery charger a few months ago and it works PERFECTLY with my Canon PowerShot A60. It charges up to 4 AA or AAA batteries in LESS THAN 3 HOURS ALL THE TIME!The charger is small and easily portable so you can bring it with you anywhere for quick charging.The only downside to the charger I have found so far is that you can't leave it in the outlet overnight or it will overheat, so you have to come back to it in 3-4 hours. Other than that, this is THE charger to buy!

You said "...but the charge only lasts a very short time."Did you know that new Ni-MH batteries must be cycled 3 to 5 times before they hold a full charge? This does not mean that they should be charged 3 to 5 times in a row but rather that for the first 3 to 5 charge/discharge cycles, the batteries reach a higher charge level each time until they are recharged until they finally reach their rated capacity. This may be your problem. Try doing this and you might be pleasantly surprised.

JVC HR-XVC1U DVD-VCR Combo
Reviewed quite a bit of the combo players and was hesitant due to unfavorable reviews and size of machines. I am weaning off my VHS collection, but don't want to replace them with DVD's. This unit is well built, easy to setup and resolution and special effects (no progressive scan for HDTV owners) suitable for many people looking for a versatile product.Cons- No universal remote.

After reading several reviews on this item, I purchased it as a Christmas gift. My brother liked it a lot, so I decided to get one for my wife and me. I'm really glad I did. It's pretty easy to set up and use, and the playback is excellent in both the VCR and DVD modes. The remote also operates my JVC TV. This is a great choice if you're looking for a quality combination player from a trusted name in electronics.

JVC HR-XVC1U DVD-VCR Combo
This is a nice combo DVD/VCR. I've had it for a couple of years now and have had no problems. That's really why I'm writing; I want to let people know the ones with problems are probably the exception rather than the rule.The only disadvantages to this product for me:1) On the VCR, you can't FF by time (a panasonic feature; FF a given number of minutes)2) Once you set the VCR program, you must hit TIMER (not just power off) to get it to use the program. Okay, hitting TIMER will turn the power off, but let's say you want to record something later in the week. You will turn your deck on and off several times in that period. Do you want to hit TIMER every time? And by the way, hitting TIMER doesn't just turn the deck off, it switches to DVD mode. In theory, this is nice so you can still use your DVD player while recording a show. In practice you just end up turning off two things (VCR via TIMER, DVD via power) most of the time.3) No S-video input. I had to buy a S-video to composite video adapter to record something from my PC video card. By the way, don't do this; the quality is pretty low.Little advantages to this product for me:1) Front panel inputs; I use this to dub from my video camera very often2) Comprehensive remote; for me, the more buttons the better. I hate on-screen menus. How can I see what the picture looks like when I adjust the tracking if 88% of the screen is the tracking menu?3) Many flavors of A/V OUTPUT: digital audio (coax and optical), composite video (of course), component video (nice for home theater), S video.Bottom line: A good combo deck for the money.

JVC HR-XVC1U DVD-VCR Combo
This VCR/DVD was an early Christmas present to myself after deciding to join the rest of the world in DVD-land but not wanting to let go of my VHS movies quite yet. Based on the reviews and price, and because I own a JVC TV, this was my choice. I agree with the easy set-up. It's a bit awkward to work the whole TV/VHS/DVD selection options but I think I've gotten the hang of it.Two comments: it's not intuitive and actually is pretty complicated (too many buttons on the remote but that might please others who are more technically-minded than me) so I've had to rely heavily on the how-to manual. And setting the VCR timer is awkward -- you can't enter the start and end time but have to scroll (unless I'm missing something)...but those are my only complaints. This is a good product for your $$$.

JVC HR-XVC1U DVD-VCR Combo
I decided to wait over a year to write a review on this unit, and thankfully my opinion since the first day I got it hasn't changed. It's wonderful! I was suprised to find a full feature DVD player included. A friend of mine bought a relatively expensive DVD player and it didn't have some of the features this unit has (albeit its a bit smaller). I have never experienced performance issues while using the DVD player in 12+ months. Zoom feature comes in handy as well, if you rent DVDs and don't necessarily want the whole long apect ratio. VCR works great as well. Recordings done in SP look excellent, colors are great and its not grainy at all. EP recordings look great for being EP as well, if you sit back on the couch you can't tell the difference. Only problem there is sometimes it takes a few seconds to track with EP, but it normally finds the right setting fairly quickly. The remote is easy to use once you learn it. It can be confusing at first, but now I wouldn't use anything else. It can control all the TV functions as well at the combo unit. If you want to take a small step into the world of DVD players, but not let go of your old VHS tapes, this is the player for you. Especially now, with the price quite reduced from when I bought it. You will not be disappointed!

JVC HR-XVC1U DVD-VCR Combo
I've had this for just over a month. I had read other reviews on this product prior to purchasing, and to me it seemed like it had received good reviews as simple-to-use machine with good attribues for not-so-electronic-literate person like myself. It had been working just fine, until few days ago I was playing a DVD and all of a sudden it would freeze, and on the TV screen there would be many different colored squares, completely distorting the image. And now, the Dvd player does not even recognize any format (I've tried CDs, DVDs, and even VCDs), as it only says &quot;Incorrect Disc&quot;.I just now found another review where the person had the same problem, had to take it to a local service center, got fixed, came back, and the exact same problem popped back up three weeks later.Reading that, I don't even know if I want to even bother taking it to get it fixed. Since it still plays VHS perfectly fine, maybe I'll just invest in a simple DVD player, which defeats the whole purpose of why I bought a DVD/VHS combo player in the first place....

B0000630MI
JVC HR-XVC1U DVD-VCR Combo
Overall, this player works great and was fairly easy to set up. However, the display is ugly (orange lettering that reminds me of my alarm clock) and only displays minutes, not seconds. Also, the lack of universal remote is a drawback. Finally, I was disappointed to learn that you can only record on the VCR in SP (2 hr) or EP (6 hour) speeds. Maybe this is standard now, but I've always liked LP mode for taping movies so you could fit two on a tape. This stuff may seem trivial. Anyway, that's my two cents.

I have had this DVD/VCR combo for a couple of weeks and it does the jobs it is supposed to. Some reviews have said the machine was noisy I have not found this to be the case,I don't even notice the DVD player making noise.It was also easy to set up and comes in crystal clear.The most important aspect for me is that you can record a TV show and watch a DVD at the same time.Some reviews stated that the VCR did not play back recorded shows well especialy if it was recorded on another vcr, I have not found this to be the case. If you do you may not have set the tape to the right speed,you have to do it manualy.The one thing that bugs me is when you have the timer program on and you want to use the vcr you have to shut the timer off and when your done turn it on again or your prgrams will not record.

I bought this unit for one reason - to play back DVD's I write with my HP DVD200i DVD+RW drive. The unit's specs don't mention DVD+RW but it's there.

I also began having the incorrect disc problems that I've read about on here. The VCR still works, but hte DVD side is useless. I understand that DVD players sometimes just quit on you, but after not even one year? To me that's a sign on bad quality. I'm giving up JVC after this as well. I'm sticking to Sony or giving another brand a shot.

I am a big JVC fan, but I do not like this model, I was suspiscious when I saw several units in the return section of the store. I bought one anyway (new) and must say I am not happy. The unit sends out clicks to the receiver once in a while, the transition between scenes is not always smooth,(like a little pause) and while it is still fairly new I can't get any DVD,CD or even a DVD headcleaner to work. All I get is a &quot;incorrect disc&quot; message.

JVC HR-XVC1U DVD-VCR Combo
This is one of the newest and hottest new combination DVD/VCR combinations on the market today. Upon picking up my purchase of the HR-XVC1U I was impressed. The finish and construction of this product is first rate, and it provides just about every feature one could hope for in a combination unit. Although it does not provide progressive scan for the HD TV owner, for those of us who have a 2 to 3 year old large screen set of 32 - 36 or projection size, it performs admirably. It will play SVHS tapes, and record and play VHS with a clarity I have not seen even on my older SVHS unit. It will also record VHS and show a DVD at the same time. Hook ups and Outputs will impress even the most demanding. The DVD will play all DVD and CD formats. The Remote, it should be noted, is not Universal with the exception of other JVC products, and the Users manual was obviously written by someone with English as a second language. However, if you are able to look past these small limitations, you will not be disappointed. I highly reccomend this product.

JVC HR-XVC1U DVD-VCR Combo
I purchased this JVC VHS/DVD combo player after my old VCR pooped out and when I decided I needed a DVD player in my room in addition to the one in our family room. I bought this player when it first came out; VHS/DVD combo players were brand new and seemed much more sensible than separate players. However, I had reservations about this unit, wondering if the quality of the DVD and VHS portions would suffer since both were crammed into one box. My fears were unfounded-- this indeed is a fantastic player!First, I really enjoy the chrome finish; it perfectly matches my silver 24&quot; flat-screen TV. Second, I love the unit's included remote. All of the buttons are solidly formed, and the rew/play/ff/rec/stop/pause buttons glow in the dark for watching movies late at night. Third, the quality of VHS recording is wonderful. I don't know what other reviewers are talking about when they complain of poor quality tape recording; everything I've taped, even on the &quot;EP&quot; (extra-long play) setting, has come out wonderfully. Sometimes, programs taped on certain VCRs look fuzzy on other sets in the house (i.e. if I try to record downstairs with a different VCR and play it back in my room), but anything I tape with this JVC unit is crystal clear on each set in our house. Fourth, I love the different A/V options the JVC unit is capable of utilizing. The JVC unit allows RCA, composite, S-Video, and component cable connections, so use whatever connection works with your TV. I strongly recommend using the component cable hookup as it offers the highest-quality picture. Fifth, I love the functions of the DVD player. Not only does this JVC player offer standard DVD functions like subtitles and markers, it also offers cool functions like zooming. DVDs, CDs, CD-Rs, and VCDs are supported, but SVCDs are not. Sixth, this quality piece of equipment comes at a great price. JVC makes a great unit, and the price is affordable, so don't buy another brand in hopes of getting a better deal.The JVC VHS/DVD player has several A/V options, provides high-quality recording, looks great, comes with a super remote, supports many popular disc formats, and does all of these things for an affordable price. If you're looking for a high-quality, yet modestly-priced piece of equipment to handle your VHS and DVD needs, look no further than this great JVC unit.

JVC HR-XVC1U DVD-VCR Combo
Trying to get two audio pieces into one box, offering decent quality, plenty of useful features & low cost may be impossible. I looked at many brands. I needed a unit that has "optical" output for DTS & 5.1 digital to go into my Marantz SR 8000 audio receiver. The cheapest units do not have this, so stay with the better name brands. At this price point I seriously doult that any brand will be very reliable. These units are not being made in Japan, which stood for excellent quality. Instead, China, Tawain, etc. are making them. Making two units into one may save on some costs, but the cost cutting may be the use of cheaper parts inside. So don't expect much from these units.I wanted to replace my older DVD player with one that plays CD-R, CD-RW, and MP3. I purchased the JVC HRXVC1, based on good reviews. JVC is the inventor of VHS vcr, and I have known people to have good luck with their electronics. I also like Panasonic,which makes very reliable electronics. I have had 3 good vcrs with Panasonic, but the clerk said that they were having higher than normal returns on their combo players. Had it not been for that, I would stay with Panasonic.This JVC HRXVC1 vcr/dvd combo has more than enough features needed to play tapes & discs. At this pricepoint it appears to be one of the best featured units I've seen. Hooking it up to my surround receiver was difficult, probably just my fault, although the book isn't clear on the hookup of the "optical" setup with the receiver connections with VCR, etc. Once hooked up, it was worth the effort. The setup was quick and easy. The cds sounded great. The dvd's are crystal clear. The vcr recorded tapes are playing good, and no problems....The GOOD: 1).It works & sounds great. 2.) It looks great on the shelf as well. 3.) There are plenty of features for the money such as Skip Search, index serch, zero return, and three step zoom. 4.) There are front inputs for camcorder or mp3 player to record easy. 5.) This unit has "SQPB" S-VHS Quasi playback which will play S-VHS tapes, and makes for excellent looking viewing of standard tapes. 6.) It has 19um head, for better picture quality in EP mode. 7.) It includes "Spatializer N-2-2" surround for people whose sytems are not setup for surround sound yet. 8.) In use, the rewind & forward is very fast.The BAD: 1.) the remote [is not good]. 2.)the buttons on the box seem unorthodox in their layout. 3.) it's confusing getting around from vcr to dvd, as some buttons have dual use, and buttons are on both sides of the unit. Petty problems, but at least the unit works fine- so far. If it proves to be unreliable, I'll write back.

JVC HR-XVC1U DVD-VCR Combo
Usually anyone purchasing a combination DVD/VCR player has particular criteria they are meeting in order to get both forms of video into their television. Space, convenience, budget among other reasons comes to mind. That aside, looking at an actual unit the person is most likely more interested about the VCR. DVD reproduction at this level looks so good that it is almost a given fact that it will perform up to someone's expectations. The VCR is another matter. For my own needs I am concerned about the playback of pre-recorded tapes and playback of home VHS recordings that I made. How the DVD/VCR player records in VHS is also important but to a lesser degree. JVC brand VCRs are an interesting and confusing animal when it comes to playback of tapes. I own two JVC S-VHS recorders with flying erase heads. I also own several SONY and older RCA VCRs from the good old days. The problem with JVC is that they play certain tapes back beautifully and others dreadfully. I took several samples of video tape recordings and demonstrated playback on this unit just to see for myself. (I know salesmen at a local electronics store in the area and they always let me try out equipment. They just love low-end technology guys like me.) Pre-recorded movies looked acceptable and I really mean no better than acceptable. Recordings I made on my JVC units in SP and EP modes looked excellent on this unit. Recordings I made on my other SONY units in the SP mode look very good. RCA recordings in SP look average. Recordings I made on my other SONY units in the EP mode looked horrible. They looked like blurred images without any trace of definition. Recordings I made on my other RCA units in LP and EP modes again looked blurred without any trace of definition. However, I made an actual recording on this unit from a satellite broadcast and the playback looked excellent. The bottom line on this unit is that the DVD side looked very good and the VCR performed just about the same as my stand-alone units which I own. There were really no surprises. When I make recordings at home I indicate which VCR the recording was made on just for the very reasons I mentioned above. After many years I have found that a recording usually looks best when played back on the unit it was made from. The reality today is that VHS is an outdated but necessary technology because many of us have a monetary and/or sentimental investment in tape recordings. I think this JVC unit is good but I rate it based upon how I would be using it relative to my library of VHS recordings and how they are going to look.

JVC HR-XVC1U DVD-VCR Combo
Love this machine! Works great! Set up was easy, although I probably made it harder than it needed to be.I spent some time trying to understand the manual. I finallly just went for it and found setting up the machine was easy.I connected the cable to the dvd player, the color coded cords from the DVD player to the TV &amp; TADA! I was done.I was able to view a VHS tape immediately or switch to a DVD. What's nice about this machine is that I don't have to got through a lot of gyrations to view a DVD or VHS tape. The Sanyo I used to have required all kinds of set up just to view a DVD. (The moon had to be in Aquarious in the seven house and the planets had to be in alignment, just kidding). But seriously, I had to write down the steps for the Sanyo just to remember how to use it. Don't think you'll have that problem with this machine. A happy customer.

JVC HR-XVC1U DVD-VCR Combo
I have to say that this is a great DVD/VCR player. The vcr picture is clear and sharp. I wish that it had VCR+, but instead you have to program the tv shows you want to tape mannually. There should also be an eject button on the remote for the vcr. It's easy to set up, although the user manul is a little confusing, and when you are done setting up what you want to record you have to press the timmer button in order for it to record the shows you want, which is a little annoying. The DVD is great, it also had a clear and sharp picture and works great. I would reccommend buying this JVC combo, because it works great, easy to set up and very little trouble.

I got this machine primarily for the DVD with MP3 playback. It turns out, that most DVD players with MP3 capability don't allow you to select "random" playing of the tracks!??? I replaced my 12 year-old CD player and my sub-par VCR with this one machine. I'm very happy with it so far, although I wish it had another component input in the back. The DVD playback is awesome. The VCR playback seems fine as well, although since getting TiVo, I don't really use it that much. I recommend this to anyone who wants a versatile player of good quality.

JVC HR-XVC1U DVD-VCR Combo
This is a fine unit for DVD playback, and has a lot of great features. But my experience with the VCR side left a lot to be desired. The machine has been saddled with a sub-par tuner which makes for noisy, color smeared VHS recordings, and its playback of factory pre-records isn't all that great either (but I will say that EP recordings don't fall off very much quality wise from SP, although the frequency response at both speeds is pretty atrocious). JVC brags about how it's the inventor of VHS. . . shame they couldn't do better here.

I'm a JVC nut...I have 3 JVC televisions, one VCR, one bookshelf audio system and car audio system. So when it came time to move the VCR player to the boys room and get another one for the old man I knew what make it was going to be. I decided on the combo player because I don't think VHS is going to be around much longer. I like my combo player except for 2 things:(1)no cable box compatability on the remote control (2)no seperate audio video inputs only input for coax cable from my cable box so all of the cable programming is in mono...wife can't tell the difference in the sound so if she's happy then I'll just live with it. VCR and DVD look and sound GREAT!!!!!!!

Sylvania 6620LDG 20-Inch Flat Panel LCD TV with Built in DVD player
My experience: I got this from FM, not Amazon. The DVD player rattled pretty loudly sometimes (but not always) when I put in a DVD. I tried several. The picture quality wasn't all that great and the screen got a horizontal line thru the middle after a short time that would not go away. Plus one of the other reviewers was dead on about the remote - the layout makes no sense at all! Very poor human engineering, IMO. I brought it back to the store for a refund. I saw the same model under the Emerson name for &lt;$400 at WM but was hesitant to buy it.

Sylvania 6620LDG 20-Inch Flat Panel LCD TV with Built in DVD player
I purchased my 6620LDG, like other reviewers, to replace my old kitchen TV. I really wanted an LCD with a built-in DVD player. While I like the TV just fine, the remote is another story. I actually wrote to the manufacturer about the remote and gave them quite an earful. Included in my e.mail was the following:"While I find the overall TV to be good, I am appalled at thequality and functionality of the remote that operates and comes withthat particular model. I simply can't believe that a name brand likeSylvania would provide such a poorly designed remote to accompany ahigher-end TV.""...this remote is very uncomfortableto hold and operate. It is as if your designers made no accommodationsfor how people hold remotes, and what makes them comfortable.""Seriously. I cantt imagine who designed the actual size and shape of that remote or which idiot approved it's public distribution, but the entire lot of them need to find other professions if they think that this remote is at all acceptable.""A remote should be, at the very least,functional and comfortable enough to go unnoticed, dont you think???? Aside from the horrid shape, size and weight of the remote, this remote has an absolutely terrible layout and lacks some of the most basic buttons that come with the cheapest of remotes. I was shocked and horrified to realize that this hideous remote had no "last channel" button. Are your designers living in the 70s or do they just have their heads up their butts?""I havent had a TV remote in my hand without a last channel button in at LEAST 20 years. Since the remote is so huge, how could it not have one of the most traditional buttons on it? I consider the very lowest and feature-less remotes to be those in hotel rooms. They look like top-of-the-line models when compared to this piece of crap.On top of not having the basic buttons, and amongst other issues, the remote is frustrating because: 1. The text is illegible, 2. The buttons are laid out in a way that doesnt make sense and 3. When you channel surf, the remote is so slow to change the channel that you want to throw it on the floor and stomp on it. In fact, if I can find a universal remote that works with this TV; I intend to do just that. Of course, to add insult to injury, it states clearly in your owners manual that 'We do not recommend the use ofuniversal remote controls. Not all of the functions may be controlledwith a universal remote control.' Great, so you provide a bottom of thebarrel remote with your TV, but then dont allow your customers to get adecent remote by making your TV uncooperative with them. This is thefirst time that I have encountered this too, BTW."Finally:"I hope that you promptly change the remote that comes with the 6620LDG LCD TV/DVD combo TV. I expect that you will experience many returns of this product due to the crappy remote that comes with it."THIS was their entire response:"Thank you for taking the time to express your concerns regarding our product. Your comments and opinions are important to us. Please understand that it is our objective to provide the best possible product. We hope you accept our apologies for the inconvenience you have experienced with our product."I am on the verge of taking this back because of the remote.

Light weight, space saving very attractive design. Sharp Picture, Good sound quality and quick response time. DVD playback also excellent. Only negative is its remote control. It is hard to read the functions of the keys due to color choices. The placement of the keys are almost illogical and you have to look at it carefully before each use. It almost seems like it was designed by an imbecil. The quality, the features and the price still makes this TV an excellent buy.

I compared a few different flat panels with review before I narrowed down my pick, which ended up with the Sylvania as over well liked. The picture got great reviews which yes it does have a good picture to look at but there are other important qualities you enjoy that makes viewing tv all the better. For example: sound... how was that forgotten?In this flat panel, it was. What a disappointment. If this is consider stereo than why does it sound like its coming from a tin can with no base at all. Then too boot, if you play the dvd, the sound drops and you have to really turn up the volume to hear.I want the whole package deal: space saving, great picture, and good sound. I want to enjoy the whole experience of watching and listening. How about you?

This TV is set so that it is not capable of a "recall" function. If you want to flash back between channels, this TV is not going to give it to you. The remote control that comes with the TV has no recall function, so I bought a Sony universal, which is a much better remote, that had the recall button on it. However, I soon learned that the TV is set at the factory to not have the capability to flash-back. It may not be a big deal to some, but this user found it very annoying.

The first one I bought was defective. The DVD didn't work at all. I purchased it from Electronics Express and when I contacted them they were wonderful. They gave me an RMA number right away, Fedex picked it up the next day and a new one arrived 1 week later. This one is just fine. I really love the clarity of the picture. My only complaint is that in DVD mode, the sound isn't loud enough. I have it in my RV and with the A/C running, I can barely hear it. I solved the problem by running an audio out jack from the TV to the input on the RV stereo speaker system. It's very lightweight and easy to move around and store. A bonus for the RV. The remote isn't great, but it works just fine and the video/audio jacks and antenna input are easy to get to as is the DVD player. All in all, it's a great deal for the price.

Sony CCDTRV108 Hi8 Camcorder with 2.5" LCD
I have used many video cameras in my life, but I have never owned one until now. I worked at audio/video stores for several years and saw lots of different formats and brands come and go. Never a fan of the VHS format or its junky little brother, Compact VHS, I knew 8mm was the way to go, at least back then. Nowadays, though, Mini DV seems to be taking over with even smaller cassettes and better picture quality. However, I don't have that kind of money to afford a DV or Digital 8mm camcorder. Yet.Enter the TRV-108, a nifty little video camera that uses the HiBand 8mm format, superior to 8mm, but certainly not in the ballpark of Digital8 or DV. Still, its compact size and light weight make it easy to carry around almost anywhere and given the first 8mm camcorder I ever used was big enough that part of it sat on my shoulder, this is a great improvement. It comes with a 160 minute `InfoLithium' battery and little else except a lens cap and strap. It takes great pictures and has a nifty menu system navigated by a little wheel at the back that works like like a volume control and when you have selected what you want from the on-screen display, you just press the wheel to make it happen. This makes titling a snap. I do miss the title image-grabbing function from older 8mm cameras, though.The 2.5" color back lit LCD screen is clear and easy to read in all but the brightest sunlight and failing that, it also has a small .5" black and white display through the view finder. The 40x zoom is fantastic, but you better have steady hands in order to use it. And using the 460x digital zoom is impossible with anything but a tripod. The camera is equipped with a nightshot mode that actually does work, amplifying light in dark areas, making the image more visible, if green. The TRV-108 also comes with some neat digital effects like sepia tone, which gives video a nice old movie look, a pastel effect which gives everything a cartoony look, black and white, 16:9 aspect shots, plus other effects. It can also do snazzy digital fade-ins and fade-outs.This camera only really has two failings. For the most part, built in camera lights are useless, but the TRV-108 doesn't even have an accessory shoe for mounting an external light source. Something I found kind of maddening to the point where I even toyed with the idea of finding a camera at a garage sale, ripping it apart, and super glue the shoe to the top. Second, while the built-in microphone is very sensitive at picking up voices and ambient sounds, it does not have a foam wind sock. In moderate winds the roar of the air as it passed over the mike caused a lot of noise. And if it's too loud, like when I shot at the base of a waterfall, the noise caused image distortion lines! These two missing features cost the camera a full five-star review.All in all though, this is a pretty decent little toy. It's not a serious camcorder and a far from a Canon GL-1s or Xl-1s, but for what I use it for, it's still pretty darn good. It's also low cost enough that purchasing it and using it as a good way to find out if you want to go for a bigger and better camera with more features, whether it be a Digital8 or Mini DV camera. It has taught me a lot about framing shots and what a pain the noon day sun can be. The long life of the battery means that, with a little mental effort, you can shoot a full 2 hour tape on one battery. Not bad for a trip to the zoo to send a tape to your folks.

Sony CCDTRV108 Hi8 Camcorder with 2.5" LCD
Hi8 is fast fading into oblivion as MiniDV takes over the world and gets cheaper. If you want good video quality, you should go with a namebrand MiniDV camcorder -- I recommend Sony, Panasonic and Canon. On the other hand, if you don't shoot a lot of videos and want something cheap, the Hi8 is still a good way to go. (I bought the TRV108 as a gift but tested it before giving it to my uncle-in-law.)To someone who's used to MiniDV camcorders, the TRV108 feels big. It's actually normal for a 8mm camcorder. The LCD screen is sharp and bright -- but as we shall see later, also a battery hog. The traditional eye-piece viewfinder is b&w;, which is bad if you want to use it to conserve battery power.The TRV108 gives out good video quality on Hi8 tapes. I would rate it "high" for a Hi8 model, but even the cheapest MiniDV camcorders (except for Samsung) can match such quality -- plus they offer more bells and whistles. One nice thing is the inclusion of Sony's NightShot infrared technology -- now you can turn your lights off and make those ghostly videos like in Blair Witch Project and Silence of the Lambs. :) The TRV108 also includes a host of effects you can add to your video footage.One bad thing, though, is this model does not have the stabilizer. The TRV308 and other more expensive models include Sony's digital stabilizer. On the other hand, digital stabilizers degrade quality, so they work better on a digital camcorder than an analog one like the TRV108. Just make sure you have sturdy hands and arms.Now the battery. The battery is definitely a problem and you'll want to buy an extra capacity battery. While the LCD turned on, you'll run out of the included battery in a matter of minutes. You can save power by using the b&w; viewfinder, but that defeats the purpose of having the LCD, doesn't it? One plus feature is the included AC adapter works at both 110V and 220V.If you have [the money], I highly recommend a MiniDV camcorder. Otherwise, make the TRV108 your entry-level home video making machine. You just can't beat its price and good quality for a Hi8 model.

I've been waiting and waiting for the best value in a Sony Hi8 Camcorder and by far this is it! This is my very first camcorder. I've been doing a lot of research and comparison on which sony model will suit me best, then this came out. I quickly grabbed it after finding out how reasonably priced it was. I bought it at [a local store] during [a] Sale... I've never laid hand on a camcorder before and I am very pleased to find out how easy it was to operate. I was able to do the playback on my TV and dubbing on my VCR with ease. It has great features, great sound and best of all best picture quality. I know there are a lot of people out there like myself who are not ready to spend a lot of money on a camcorder especially for the very first time. Well, you will not be disappointed with this one! It comes with all the accessories to get you started. Battery charging is very fast, instructions are easy to follow when it comes to recording, playback and editing, the night shot feature is great, best of all the LCD screen is so fun to use especially when you have a "little one" to capture on video. This is definitely as great buy!

This was our family's first camcorder and I'd have to say that it does its job wonderfully. This camcorder has all the basic features you need to create great home videos. Our results so far are very satisfying. The only drawback is that you must buy an extra battery AND a camcorder bag! These are essential accessories that you must get if you plan to travel with your camcorder. What I love about this camcorder is that it could automatically convert to 220V, which is great when you travel. There's also the nightshot feature. I guess what this lacks is the 'image stabilizer.' However, I heard that stabilizers may actually worsen the picture quality on Hi8 camcorders. Whatever the case, we are very happy with our purchase and would highly recommend this product. It's high quality by a great brand and it would last you til you upgrade ...

Wanted a camera for Christmas and got this one because of the price, and needless to say it's a great camera. Just got back from DisneyWorld and the 108 performed extremely well. The nightshot proved handy in those dark rides, and the quality of picture was well for the Festival of the Lion King performance. The only problem I saw was that the autofocus was slow to adapt at times during those fireworks and laser shows. I didn't expect it to keep up, but it did better than I expected. Talk about impact resistant, I had a hissy when it fell out of the bag into the boat on the pirates of the carribean, but it took a lickin and it's still ticking. Once home, I just connected it to my TV and watched my vacation replay. Great camera for the price, definately worth more. Only thing better is digital. Sony has a winner here.

My old hi 8 went caput after 10 years use that was very trouble free.The new one has way more features that the 100 and costs much less. ...I use the viewfinder instead of the display as I am used to it and so far have recorded 3 hours on it and it tells me I have 2 hours left. I used the telephoto constantly which takes power put am very happy with the resultsI recharge the battery after use with the no memory effect so no problems. I use the supplied battery for dubbing and it will run 2 hrs in the dubbing mode which is great.I dub hi 8 super vhs output to a super vhs vcr and do not notice andy difference in the quality of the dub.Yes there is a more blurry picture if you dub to standard vhs but that is normal.Unless you want to do some super pro stuff this camera is the one to get.

The camera is very easy to use. It's not as bulky as other reviews make it out to be. The battery life has been great and the picture clarity has been great also. I have been using it to tape track meets and everything can be seen clearly. Remember that you will have to buy tapes for this camera, but that is no problem for the clarity you will get. I have not tried out all the other features like night vision, but from what I have seen so far, this camera is a real good bargain. I know 5 other people who have the same item and they do not have any complaints.The flip out lcd screen is clear also. It's like using a digital camera...but only with the tapes. Only downside I have seen is that it is a little hard to keep steady based on the videos watched. The camera seems to move around alot, but again, the picture clarity is great regardless of the low price. If you don't want to upgrade to ditigal, start with this camcorder. You will not be disappointed.

I was very pleased with the video camera. However, it had a problem which turned out to be a blessing in disguise. Like my original camera, it wouldn't move the tape in any direction. More than that, the tape would not go all the way down and came back out. Then I noticed that a rubber roller (turned out to be the capstan roller) was loose at the bottom of the tape area blocking the tape from going all the way down. I shook it out, but the tape wouldn't move ... just like the problem with my original video camera. Upon looking closer at my original camera, I noticed the capstan roller was loose in it also but not in a position that didn't prevent the tape from loading. After finding the manual on-line, I saw where the capstan went.I know I wouldn't have been able to fix my original camera if I hadn't purchased my new cameral through Amazon. Since I just paid half of what the original camera cost me (which was already heavily discounted), I am very happy with the result. Further searching on-line revealed to me that this is a common problem with this camera. The solution was also revealed ... always have a tape in the camera, and the capstan will not get loose. I suspect that when the camera was mailed to me that it was working fine, but the rigors of the shipment probably knocked the capstan loose since it came with no tape insideSony CCDTRV118 Hi8 Camcorder with 2.5" LCD. I am very happy at this unusual experience, and continue to be delighted that I have had great results everytime I purchase anything from Amazon. The reason I purchased the 2nd camera is that I have a lot of tapes of my grandson (now 21) playing Little League baseball that I want to copy onto DVDs and now will take more videos of my younger grandson playing ball. One thing I've always loved about this camera is that it is easy to use, and it has a zoom to "kill for." Sometimes I use it as an electronic telescope because it is so powerful.

I exclusively buy Sony Electronics because in my opinion they are the best. When I bought this Camera I knew that the quality would be there because it is a Sony. The camera works well except it is a little bulky. I primarily use this camera to film my son playing in the little league and it works well at capturing high speed action. It also is somewhat impact resistant because at his last little league game the umpire claimed my son was out when he was safe. Everyone knew that except for the umpire himself. I hit that fat porker right in the face with the camera (while it was on) and it captured everything - the picture quality was amazing and the sound was crystal clear. That fat slob hit the floor like a ton of bricks and was out cold. A couple of weeks later I got a letter from his lawyer and I had to appear in court because he filed a lawsuit against me. I showed the judge the tape of my son being safe and even he commented on the quality of the sound and picture and said my son was not out either. The judge dropped the charges all because of this great little camera.

This protector is an excellent value. Rated very highly in consumer publications. Great price from Amazon. I bought this to protect my new 55 inch LG flat screen.

I bought one of these to protect my washing machine. I can't really know for sure whether or not this device has protected my washer from any power surges, as both the washing machine and the APC P1T are still both fully functional, but my understanding is that APC is a highly regarded company in the power protection industry, so I believe this is a quality product.

This is a wonderful product that is compact enough for me to keep my laptop plugged into it at all times and move it from plug to plug. When the apartment building next to mine was struck by lightning, I decided that I better get a surge protector and this portable option was just what I wanted.

This product description is WRONG. I purchased this product because of this "$25,000" equipment warranty. Product received only states that the actual surge protector is under warranty and has no mention of equipment warranty. Is Amazon starting to make stuff up now?

I bought one of these after seeing them in the APC catalog.It's a handy thing: LEDs let you know if the ground is workingas well as if the surge arrest is functioning.The only thing that could be improved is that it's a Wart andtakes up about as much space as a transformer; this becomesan issue if sharing a plug with someone else at the coffeeshop.APC makes good stuff and the $25k warranty is nice as well.Foob

We've experienced a couple of serious lightning surges in our immediate area over the past four years. We protect our electronics with APC UPS battery back-up systems for the expensive stuff and use the P1T where a UPS can't fit (for the refrigerator, garage door openers, etc.) or for smaller electronics like telephone answering systems and laptops. None, and I mean none, of the items protected by APC surge suppression or UPS systems have ever been damaged. I can't say the same for devices "protected" by other manufacturers surge and back-up systems. We've found a winner and we're sticking to it.

There are many notebook surge protectors on the market and most lack the obvious: durability and functionality. Not so with this little gem. The APC P1T has one job and it does that well. Indicator lights provide assurance that the unit is protecting your computer and the solid plastic shell is about as tough as they come for a portable device. The metal prongs are equally durable and will not bend or break. I have purchased two for use in different locations. Price and performance make this a stand-out item.

This little thing does it's job and does it well. Had a power line come down in my front yard the other day when I wasn't home. Needless to say, when the power came back on, It blew all of my outlets. Thank god I had my laptop plugged into The P1T, it destroyed the P1T but saved my laptop! Definately will be purchasing another one of these.

Great value for a surge protector. I've got 'em on lots of electronics (printers, phones, laptops) that don't need a full power strip or universal power supply (UPS). Very portable for laptops, in case you're travelling.

What can I say it is a surge protector and small enough to use with small electronic items such as a wireless phone system, isolated devices and so on that do not need a big strip.

I purchased this surge protector for my new Macbook Pro 15.4" laptop. It's a handy size, great for taking with you or for using at home. There are two lights, one indicating if it the outlet is grounded and another to indicate if it is protected. Great little item and great price.

When you are traveling, often you have two competing problems. One, you need to pack as lightly as possible to avoid outrageous charges. Two, you absolutely need to protect your laptop or other device from iffy power. The APC Personal SurgeArrest 1 Outlet 120V meets both of those needs.This literally plugs into any normal three-prong outlet - and you then plug your own plug into this unit. The unit provides solid grounding and protection for you. Lights illuminate to show you that the system is working. It's about as small as it can get. It's easily portable. And you know you aren't risking your valuable laptop, tablet, or other device to the iffy wiring of the hotel or place you're staying.In addition to the main plug where the PC or other item gets connected, there are also three phone style jacks on the bottom. One is an "in" jack where the building signal goes into the unit. The other two are "out" jacks for both a handset and a laptop connection.Great as something to always have in your luggage, to ensure your valuable electronic items stay protected. I definitely carry one of these with me.

Sony CCDTRV608 Hi8 Camcorder with 3.0" LCD, Video Light & USB Streaming
Hi.I got this camcorder few days before, and now using it daily almost 5 hours in day. I have listed out some of the Advantasges and problems i face with this new avtar of sony lineup.1. The quailty of the recorded is very good and i feel happy when i shoot videos inside the house in low light, the lense did a good job.2 Nightshot feature is also impressive and i have shoot some videos in total darkness and quailty is really good.3. The battery that comes with the Kit is seems to be OK , if you are not planning to use the LCD while recording. You can also choose the battery with the higher life time.4. The most welcome feature is the USB straeming of your data by connecting to ur PC. i have brodcast my movie using the yahoo messanger webcam feature and its done very well.Well now i m sorry to say but this machine has some inbuilt problmes like.1. If you are planning to capture the recorded video on your computer using the USB and the supplied software named PIXELA, u will be disappointed with the quailty as it was very very bad.2. The built in light does not seem to have an great extent while working on the low lights.3. The external Microphone Input is not provided and u have depend on the inbuilt mic.In last, if you are a new comer and ur requirments are not like gorge lucas , u can easily go for this low budget handycam and enjoy the pleasure of movie making.

Sony CCDTRV608 Hi8 Camcorder with 3.0" LCD, Video Light & USB Streaming
I got this camcorder last week to take with us on vacation. Last year we had used a VHS-C camcorder that we borrowed. We enjoyed using it, but we had to get this adapter to play those little tapes in the VCR.I got this camcorder mostly because it has streaming USB. It is incredible!! Technology sure has changed. The software and driver were easily installed (even on Windows XP!!) and then there was the movie, on my computer!! I could capture stills and then either edit them with the packaged software or export them to Photoshop Elements. It is very easy to use with a ton of features and it even films in the dark!! We went into our bathroom and turned out the lights, turned on "night-shot" and lo and behold we could see in the dark and record!! Also the camcorder just hooks to the VCR so you can play your movies on the TV. It's like have a digital camera and camcorder in one... I am really impressed with this product and am very glad that I got it!!

For the money I don't think you will find a better camcorder.I've had mine for about a week &amp; I'm very happy with it.I think you could spend alot more for digital and not get asmany useful features. Basically its very easy to use but alsocontains some advanced functions. Picture quality is outstanding.Sony really outdid itself on this one.

Sony CCDTRV608 Hi8 Camcorder with 3.0" LCD, Video Light & USB Streaming
1. The Camera is esay to use, simple which makes it great for use at anytime.2. The Camera is stylish and not at all heavy.3. For connecting to your PC it's easy and works great.4. Price is great, not too expensive.5. Disappointment: The pictures are really pixeled and not at all that clear, even at close distances. Even still shots, aren't that clear. I'm not sure if this is related to the PIXELA program or not. Also I have to import the movie and then the sound which makes it hard to even make a 1 minute movie, then edit the sound into the movie and having it come together in unison.In conclusion: The one most important thing is missing, a clear picture. This is the reason many of us bought this. To capture the smile, laugh, or action of a loved one.

I have owned several camcorders, as a matter of fact, I returned three until I decided on the Sony 608. The majority of analog camcoders do not offer all the features as this, along with the quality and usability, the 608 is your best bargain.It is smaller than the average and yet has the larger screen (3 inch). The usb streaming feature is fun and easy to use and produces remakable images on your computer. The 20x analog zoom, as well as the 560x digital is more than enough for any usage. The nightshot feature actually works in total dakness. I cannot see spending hundreds more for slightly better digital quality. I am totally satisfied.

Sony CCDTRV608 Hi8 Camcorder with 3.0" LCD, Video Light & USB Streaming
This is my first camcorder of any kind. i have used other types, VHS, VHS-C, 8mm, but this is probably the best that i have used. It's easy to learn the basics with and takes really great videos. The USB streaming capability is really easy to use and works great. Pixela seems to pixilate(spelling?) the movies, but it's nothing that really hurts and it's that severe. The NightShot is great, the lamp is really good, and the camera has a few little effects for the pictures. No big complaints except a remote would be nice for playback, and a colored viewfinder. But with a 3" color LCD screen, the chance that someone will use the viewfinder is small. i recomend this camera to anyone who doesn't want to spend a lot on a good quality camera.

Sony CCDTRV608 Hi8 Camcorder with 3.0" LCD, Video Light & USB Streaming
This overall is a great camcorder. I used it for a year and had very little trouble with it. I've made a list of good and bad things about this camcorder that will hopefully help you in your decision.First the good stuff1.It has a nice big LCD screen for easy viewing when recording2.There are plenty of different features for recording in different lights3.It has OK sound and picture quality4.It is good for families, groups, teachers or anyone else who just needs a good quality camera for a cheap price that they can use to to record family outings exc...Now for the bad stuff.1. The size of the camera is a little big. it is hard to hold for long periods of time and somewhat heavy (if you have a tripod and you use it this shouldn't be too much of a problem).2. the battery life could be better (only about 50-60 minuets with the LCD screen).3. the sound is a bit metallic, and the picture doesn't show reds or yellows well.4.if you have the need to edit your recordings it will be very hard and somewhat expensive with this camera. If you want to edit, I would definitely recommend a digital camcorder instead because it will be much easier for you to edit your videos (this was my big mistake and I had to sell it for a Sony digital).If this review has helped you or if you want to ask me any technical questions, e-mail me at dave_lancer@hotmail.com

Sony CCDTRV608 Hi8 Camcorder with 3.0" LCD, Video Light & USB Streaming
This is a great camera. I had an older Sony camera which I used Dazzle to bring my video to the PC. When I heard this camera had USB steaming I was excited. The quality and the images are really poor. It produces a very blocky MPEG-1 movie. There is also a post processing time in which PIXELLA converts the movie to MPEG. Dazzle USB brings in my movies faster with no post processing time, it also produces a MPEG-1 movie. Dazzle only pushes video through the USB and uses your sound card to bring in sound. This is in contrast to USB Streaming which pushs video and sound through the USB. I guess because of this architecture, the video bitrate must be lower because it is shared with the sound and thus produces a lower quality image.Other than that, the camera is excellent.

I've had the camcorder for a while now, and was hoping to be able to use the USB streaming feature to make small computer movies and send them to my friends and family overseas. Although the camcorder is good the included software is weak and the USB streaming makes a very choppy poor quality AVI file. I recently got a new computer and could not find the device driver disk that came with the camcorder. Sony technical support was a joke and they ended up trying to sell me a driver for my camcorder. So now I have a camcorder that I can plug into my TV or record onto a VHS (Do people still use VHS?) but any dreams I have of putting something on my computer are fading fast. I'm going to have to find a new way to send my parents the video I took of my new house.Frankly in this day and age an analogue camcorder is a waste of money.

I got this camcorder for capturing my 6 month old baby. Wow, I am pleased with this soo much. When you look at camcorders and see some for 200.00, 250.00, 300.00, and the 2000.00 digital everyone needs think of this. The more money you put into a product...THE BETTER. This was the case here forsure. I can go into a bathroom with all the lights off at 12 pm and turn on my night vision on my camcorder and find my little pee pee. lol, Hmm, like 10 yrs ago or even a lot less, night vision would cost you thousands of dollars. This was a feature I didnt even know I was getting. The zoom is LiGhTnInG FAST. I catch myself overzooming on the first 2 tapes I recorded. This is one hell of a camcorder and I recommend it for a person that wants quality for the money spent.

I've had two of these, and both of them lasted about a year? Both of them had the same malfunction- tapes jamming in the camera. I talked to a repair shop & they see this a lot with sonys because of the design. Using purchased movie software we were able to make good movies in our pc & burn to dvd. Using pixela software included we could capture still shots (good enough for listing things on ebay, etc.) which was a novelty then!

This is a great camera. We use it a lot. I love the night shot, the steady shot works great and it has a lot of other nice features. Everything on it works great all the time. The light metering and auto focus work very well too.There is only one problem that really frustrates me. It has a right and a left microphone and records in stereo, but there is no way to get stereo playback through the analog A/V output. That's certainly one of the cheapest things I've seen in products that I've bought. It's very disapointing from a name like Sony.

This is my second camcorder. My first camcorder was an early Sony 8mm. That was part of the reason I stayed with the format. I have used the TRV608 for a wide array of events, my kids are involved in music and sports so I have used the camcorder in many different situations indoors and out with outstanding results. One of my children used the camera for a &quot;movie&quot; for a school project and made a great grade.I am very pleased. The clarity is amazing and the low level performance is incredible. An S-video cable does help the video image. Perhaps one of the other reviewers had a bad camcorder, but I am glad I chose this camcorder.Sony reliability and quality is hard to beat. The only drawback I see at this time is the audio quality isn't up to digital, but since I wanted the better lowlight performance I went analog. Perhaps as the digital technology improves in lowlight I will go digital.

Sony CCDTRV608 Hi8 Camcorder with 3.0" LCD, Video Light & USB Streaming
While this is a decent Analog camcorder, don't expect much from the USB streaming feature. The maximum frame size over USB is 320x240, which is half the minimum recommended for creating a DVD out of a home movie. If you want to get the video from your tapes onto a computer or DVD, expect to purchase a separate video capture device or card.To make matters worse, the bundled software doesn't let you capture more than thirteen minutes of video at a time before it crashes and claims the drive is out of disk space, regardless of how much disk space you really have avaliable. This happens even when recording to NTFS volumes, which do not have the 4 gig file size limit of Fat32.Most third party programs will also have issues using the camcorder's USB streaming features. The drivers create an eclectic audio device that many video capture programs can't see, so you'll have to use a separate audio cable unless you like the idea of not having any sound. Roxio's products are among the many that can't use the audio driver.In short, it's a decent camcorder, assuming you compare it to other devices as though the USB streaming feature didn't exist, because for all practical purposes, it doesn't.

This is truly an excellent camcorder for home movies and perhaps more advanced applications. I found myself toying around with the nightvision contantly. My only qualms about it was that recording videos to your PC is really dependent on how good a computer you have. For instance, my computer, which is fairly fast would typically have very smooth recording, but every once in a while would skip a few frames, and I would then have to go back and edit it. But don't get me wrong, I truly believe that this really is the best camcorder you can buy for this kind of money, and besides the computer transfer issure, I absolutely love the camera.

The picture on this camera is good and it needs very little light. However, the colors are not quite as accurate as I had hoped for Hi8. Perhaps digital would have been better, but the price was a factor. I shopped around and found Amazon had the best price available.

I bought it new in 2002 for $400. The color is pretty good. The resolution is very poor, only close shot get you satified. Other than that you get blur edge and barrel distortion sometimes. I didn't use it a lot for the first 3 years, only the last 2 years I used it regularly to tape my daughter's piano class homework every 2 weeks for 5-8 minutes each time. Recently I have to knock this camera extremly hard several times to make the recording start (It's common issue as the piano teacher told me.). So I have to find a new camcorder now. I don't know what can I do if it refuses to work one day in my daughter's piano class.

TIC Corporation TFS5SL 6.5 Inch 150-Watt Terra-Forms Rock Speakers (Slate)
Purchased these to leave on the patio for background music and for a backyard movie theater. These are not speakers for an audiophile, but are a great value and serve their purpose--that being an unobtrusive speaker that can be left outside. They sounded better than I had expected, though seemed to struggle a bit on bass side. Turning the base level on my receiver up significantly seemed to compensate for this, and I'm quite satisfied now. Ample volume for a small backyard theater (the space I use them in is about 20x30 feet, with about 10-12 people watching).As for aesthetics, they do look like rocks and blend in very nicely with the rock wall that borders my yard. At first, people don't even notice they're there and wonder where the sound is coming from (a definite plus as far as my wife is concerned). I wouldn't hesitate to buy again, though would consider upgrading to one of their higher-end models if fidelity was higher on the cost/fidelity preference scale.

Sony CCDTRV308 Hi8 Camcorder with 2.5"LCD and Video Light
I recently purchased this camera and have been very pleased with its performance. When weighing out the decisions of which camera to buy, it can be very confusing. Which format should I choose? Hi-8, Digital, MiniDV? All of these can seem confusing. For the novice cameraman this camera provides a perfect blend of form and function. The LCD screen is large and vibrant and provides for an easy way to see what you're filming without haveing to peer into a viewfinder.The only drawback of this camera is that the battery life tends to be pretty short-lived. However, you can purchase an extended life battery which comes in handy if you want to record for extended periods of times. One extremly useful feature of this camera is the light, which really works well at night. Also, a really cool feature of this camera is the ability to shoot in complete darkness (via an infared filming capability).In a nutshell, if you want great quality and extreme affordability this camera is for you.

If you want nothing more than a really good camcorder to take basic videos, the Sony CCDTRV308 is the way to go.It's probably the best Sony Hi8 camcamcorder you'll get without all the bells and whistles that let you download video on to your PC.It has a few great features like NIGHTSHOT (which allows video in virutal darkness) and STEADYSHOT. Also, the 20X zoom works really well. (Don't be impressd by the 460X digital zoom-- on any camcorder; the image becomes more blurry the closer you zoom in with it.)You'll probably have to get another battery, as the one the Sony CCDTRV308 comes with will only last for about an hour or so when using all the functions (LCD screen, stop and start REC). I recommend buying the NP-QM71; it lasts between 4 and 6 hours.BUT (A VERY BIG BUT), If you want to anything more than basic VCR editing, get at least a MiniDV, especially if you're willing to spend between $500 and $1000. I was willing to drop $500 for a MiniDV because I wanted to easily edit my videos, but I wasn't willing to spend another $500 to upgrade my PC to accomodate the large amounts of data.Otherwise, the Sony CCDTRV308 is a great Hi8 camcorder for basic video recording and little or no editing.

We purchased this camcorder for the holidays, selecting the CCDTRV308 over the CCDTRV108 due to it's added features such as image stability and auto-light. It arrived within three days - amazing! With my son's birthday coming up at the weekend, and the speedy delivery, it was a real test as to whether I could read the manual and become comfortable in the camcorder's use before the big day. The instructions are clear, concise and easily referenced.We chose official Sony cassettes for this first run to ensure optimal picture quality and compatibility. Image quality is excellent, but we did notice that it performs better after it has 'warmed up'. This might be due to cassette stability or electronics temperature, but in no way detracts from this product's quality. Fade in/out options are excellent and with the 'cinema' setting gives your production that 'ER' feel.I suspect that upgrading to a higher capacity battery may be a next step, but it lasted through the kid's party with ease. About 30 minutes of shooting remained, even though we used the LCD the whole time.Title use is a little confusing, but you do get the option of creating two custom titles in addition to the standard fare.The tripod was prepared, just in case the weight of the camcorder became tiring, but it was not needed. The lightness of these new camcorders over the ones of yesteryear makes life much easier, and is not burdening.We researched considerably, before purchasing this product, which is no guarantee of success, but I have no hesitation in recommending it to those considering a Hi-8 camcorder.

I've been trying to buy a video camera for the past 6 years (ever since my first monster bought in 1990 died). I finally bit the bullet since this camera seemed so reasonable and so highly-rated. I'm happy with every aspect of this camcorder. The bells and whistles are surprisingly complete, and it's so lightweight that I can (and do) spend the entire day with it in my hand.One caveat...a wide angle lens would be a smart purchase. It's difficult to get far enough away from the action and still hear what is going on.

More functions and options would just go to waste and be confusing.It is light and ergonomic and I got a free tripod and camera bag with mine at circuit city. I wouldn't buy electronics on line again (been there done that). A longer battery life would be all I would ask for .

I just got the CCD-TRV-308 camcorder and it is awesome!! The only thing is is that you cant edit your film on your computer you can just play it back. I give 4 - 4 1/2 stars

Sony CCDTRV308 Hi8 Camcorder with 2.5"LCD and Video Light
I needed a third camcorder with NightShot for my paranormal investigations and since I have two Mini DV's, wanted a Hi8 because they record for so much longer (tape length). I also have lots of Hi8 video I shot while I was in the military that I want to transfer to DVD so after a lot of research chose the CCD-TRV308.It has a built in light which I don't really need since I shoot mostly in zero light. The camera is solid and very large compared to my Mini DV camcorders and most of what is available today. As with most Sony camcorders, the NightShot only works in a very limited capacity. I always use them with a SIMA infrared light which fits nicely on this camera due to its larger size. One note, the built in NightShot on this camera is at least twice as bright as the NightShot on my two newer Mini DV models. I still use an external IR light but This one works pretty good on its own compared to the others. I have video posted on YouTube showing some of the NightShot stuff if anyone is interested.If you need a quality camcorder for any of the reasons listed above I recommend the CCD-TRV308. If you plan on using it for extended periods of time you will probably find it bulky and heavy by today's standards.

The camera model may be fine, but the used one we bought had multiple defects. Power cord would not seat correctly and any minor jiggle killed the power. Once opened, the cassette holder would not retract consistently. Seller offered the obligatory replacement/return, which was appreciated.

Bought this as a "back up" to my other Sony Hi8. I like the analog picture (vs. digital). Real handy, works just like the vendor indicated. No problems since I purchased it about 1.5 years ago. I'd buy again.

Oh I love this little light. I keep it on my desk. Just theright lighting for my late nights on the pc. The top opens upto a pull down magnifying glass. I would recommend it.

Yeah, so, I'm not much on cross-stitching. My mitts are too beefy, skin too oily, too much testosterone. But I like having cross-stitching accessories around; skeins of floss, blunted needles, wooden frames, piles of patterns, etc. They're all carefully arranged in a spare room of my house so that when chicks come over I can open the door and say "And here's my craft room...." and they think I'm all sensitive and 'in touch with my feminine side' and blah blah blah blah blah. The only thing missing - which most of said chicks were quick to point out - was an OTT-LITE(R) TrueColorTM) Portable Magnifier Lamp. So now I have one. And they have no excuse any more.

Western Digital 120 GB 7200 RPM Ultra ATA/100 IDE Internal Hard Drive
I have the 8 MB cache version of this hard drive. The speed of this hard drive is ok. Ease of installation is average. It runs quietly until recently the spinning sound is getting louder. Also once in a while it makes some kind of clicking noise followed by a beep. I used to own Seagate, Quantum, and Maxtor hard drives and none of them have this kind of noise.So far there is no data loss or any kind of damage. But this is very annoying because I am afraid that something is going to happen.

Western Digital 120 GB 7200 RPM Ultra ATA/100 IDE Internal Hard Drive
This hard drive is by far, the best one on the market. I'm sure that the 160 and 180 gb are just as good. I was building my own computer, and trying to get the best of everything. First, the installation was easy. As I built my computer the hd was one of the last things that I connected. For your info I have built two 2 computers using this drive. First one was a pentium 4 2.8 ghz. With an Asus P4PE board. I used an ATI Radeon 9700 Pro for video,1.5 gb of DDR RAM. I used an antec alluminum case with 3 case fans. I used a Sound Blaster 5.1 Live Audigy Platinum. I had 3 case fans, a glass window on my case, a DVD RW pioneer drive, and a teac floppy. The second one was almost identical, except it used a duel athlon I was extremely happy with it, and I suggest that anyone interested in a hd seriously consider this one.

Saitek Stylus With Light (LIGHTSTYLUS)
For years, I've seen combination pens with lights, but this lighted stylus is just the ticket for using your PDA in the dark, especially on Palm models with an unlit Graffiti panel.The Light Stylus comes with four interchangeable tops to fit a wide variety of PalmOS PDAs (the one I bought doesn't claim to fit PocketPC models.) One of them was a near-perfect match for my Palm i705 stylus, and in fact fit even better than the factory stylus in that it isn't as tight a fit. I did have some difficulty switching the top - there are no instructions - but a firm pull does the trick. There's even a reset pin under the top!The light is yellow and reasonably bright - good enough for use in the dark, though it's no flashlight. As a general-use stylus, it works well - the translucent plastic tip has a good writing feel. The only issue I have, and this is minor, is that sometimes you have to play with the rotation of the top to get the light to stay on, or off. Once you find the right position, though, it stays.Inexpensive enough to be an impulse-buy (as it was for me), the Saitek Light Stylus is a great idea at a great price. I recommend it to all Palm PDA users.

Saitek Stylus With Light (LIGHTSTYLUS)
This would be a nifty little contraption if it wasn't for the fact that you can't change the top -- my primary impetus for buying it.I have a Handspring Visor and lost my stylus. I didn't want to pay for shipping on a new stylus 3-pack from Handspring, so I went to Best Buy and purchased this instead. Not only can you not change the top so that it fits in the Visor properly, but now the entire headpiece falls out constantly so that the bottom part of the stylus gets stuck in the stylus-holder. Oh, and did I mention that the light function only works part of the time?Not worth your time or effort.

Macally PS-AC4 AC Power Adapter for Apple G4
Does just what was needed to charge the Macbook Pro G4 13inch laptop. Only beef was it no longer lights up the connection at the laptop like the Apple one did. No problem though, a green light shows it is plugged in and the full charge signaled a cool down to a cold power brick by morning.

This product works well. I got it for my iBook G3 in a pinch when the original adapter fell apart during finals week. This adapter lacks the cute design and green/orange light that indicates charge status on the original, but it charges the battery sufficiently. It is a great deal.

This power adapter is exceptional compared to the flimsy designed Apple adapter that NEVER held onto the outlet due to its own weight. All Macally needs to do is equip it with a charge light indicator and then it will be a complete home run instead of a ground triple.

Macally PS-AC4 AC Power Adapter for Apple G4
This is the best replacement power supply I've seen for a Powerbook or iBook. It's solid and you won't have to worry about the cords pulling out or the connector breaking like on the $70 Apple units. The only downside is that it's a bit less sleek and ergonomic than the Apple.

You'd have to be crazy to purchase a full-priced replacement adapter directly from Apple. Third-party is the way to go here, and this Macally adapter is a great value overall.Pros: Cheap as heck, long cord, does what it's supposed to do.Cons: Cord does not easily wind up. If my PowerBook G4 is totally out of juice, the Macally needs to charge it for a few minutes before the computer will power itself up again.

This product is much better than the Apple OEM charger in terms of durability. It has a blue light on the adapter that lets you know if it's plugged in, but there is no indication that your computer is being charged like the OEM one. That being said I am very pleased with it and you could almost buy two of these units for the price that apple wants for their flawed version.

This power adapter has only half the Amp rating needed to power the powerbook G4 17". It took 14 hours to charge the battery and still used the battery partially when the computer was in use and the power was connected though the adapter. I noticed that they left out the Amps it has in the advertising. The other reviews below must be fake or they have a smaller G4 powerbook or an iBook.

Macally PS-AC4 AC Power Adapter for Apple G4
Like a lot of other folks, I agree that it's a) a good price and b) a good product. I do want to add that, although I know for some the connection between the brick and the cord to the computer seems a little flimsy (it's got little notches but not the slide and lock bit like the Apple cord) it was a godsent when I accidentally tripped a family member with the cord because it pulled apart rather than breaking/damaging the cord. I'm not certain if it's supposed to do that, but I do know that if that had happened with the Apple cord (if it had not already crapped out on me) it would have significantly damaged the cord.So - woo - thumbs up. Also, my dad survived the tripping incident without significant injury.

I have been extremely happy with this power adapter for my iBookG4 that I bought about a month ago. I had bought another seemingly similar product through a different source four months ago - and that OTHER company's adapter was a nightmare. Left everyone ears ringing from its high pitched humming. This Macally Power Adapter has been a wonderful replacement to the original power adapter which came with my MAC. I could not be more pleased. Well worth the price and so grateful that I found something that works as well as it is supposed to. Recommend this product fully to anyone interested!!!

Macally PS-AC4 AC Power Adapter for Apple G4
I've owned my mac iBook G4 for a year now, in that year I have been through two (yes 2!) STANDARD APPLE CHARGERS! I finally bought this as a cheaper alternative because I didn't have $85 to buy another crappy charger from Apple. This Macally charger (since I have owned it-a month) has been sublime. The cord reaches further, and the connection to my charger port is solid. It also lacks that annoying third prong (I have an older house so I don't have many of them). You can use your laptop as soon as you plug the charger in, so you don't have to wait.The cons to the product are miniscule and vain. It doesn't have that cool light that tells you when the computer is finished charging, and it is rather bulky. But despite it's cons. At least it works which is better that Apple's cool looking charger that doesn't work long.BEWARE OF OTHER IMITATIONS!!!! The ones with the white and black cords. THat is not Macally. And it is such total crap. You'd be better off buying the original charger.

The Macally power adapter purchased two months ago operates flawlessly. Improvements on Apple's design suggest that this product will provide years more reliable service than Apple's.

Macally PS-AC4 AC Power Adapter for Apple G4
I decided to give this a try after taking a look at the Apple price for their replacement (averaging $80, s/h NOT included). The reviews helped ease my mind about using another party replacement for the adapter as well, and for the 1st few months everything seemed ok,although I kind of wished the connection seemed more secure. Unfortunately, in the past 2-3 months or so, I'd noticed the somewhat 'loose' fit of the plug had gotten worse, so much so that just adjusting the laptop on my legs would mean it often falls out. At this point, now I have to keep checking the connection to make sure it's still inside the Mac. I'll glance up at the battery indicator and won't see the charging icon, but rather that my battery's being used for God only knows how long. Then I'll have to press the plug back in again. I took the Macally adapter out one day to look at it closely and discovered what the real issue is: the thin metal ring around the 'male' charging piece has a slight split/bend in it, which means it isn't fitting snugly in the Mac's charging portal. I don't know how long this has been there. I'm pretty careful w/ my Mac stuff, so I'm relatively sure it wasn't damaged from being wound up in my laptop case and I *know* I wouldn't be jamming the thing into this expensive hardware, so I'm at a loss. I only know it never really fit in the charge slot correctly from word-go and now it's just barely staying in long enough to keep the charge unless I'm absolutely still. I'm really disappointed in this. I'm hoping to get it replaced under the mfgr warranty. If not, I'm certain not to repeat my mistake by purchasing another Macally adapter. At $30 a pop, buying a 2nd one would be foolish when I could just purchase the 'official' Apple replacement for 20 bucks more.

I often had trouble keeping the standard iBook charger in my laptop, and finally my dog managed to break it. I like the MacAlly replacement better because it's very sturdy and stays connected to the input jack. It lacks the green/yellow LED indicator, but you can see if it's charging in the menu bar.Great replacement charger for the price.

B0001YXWVO
Macally PS-AC4 AC Power Adapter for Apple G4
The adaptor works really well on my ibook or powerbook. It has a really long extension cord. The only problem is that it is slightly more bulky than the apple one. So, for traveling around, unless you have a big computer case, it will not fit nicely. Other than that, it is great. Much cheaper than a new apple adapter and works just as nicely. It is also sturdier than the apple adaptor and does not have the annoying light.

B0001YXWVO

I take my iBook everywhere so I keep this one sitting at home and leave the OEM charger in my bag. It has saved me the trouble of having to wrap the charger up every time I have to leave the apartment. A small win, but well worth the price. I've found it to be quite durable as well.

oddly, this version is not as good as the same version of the product that i purchased about a year ago. this version is missing a nice little blue light that indicates that the charger is plugged in and operating, but more importantly, seems to take forever to charge batteries. i bought two at the same time, and both exhibit the same behavior.

I bought this to replace the supposedly same power adapter that I purchased last year. This is NOT the same adapter as pictured for the item (I see that a customer has added two pictures of the true product). I was not concerned with this difference but would have preferred to have a light indicating the power is on. At first, it seemed to power my powerbook G4 fine, but later it started to cycle as charging and not charging, thus making the screen brighten and darken. When I shut the computer and let it charge, it did charge some, but I'm concerned about ruining my battery (which is also a replacement). It simply does not work when you are using the computer..and I'm ALWAYS using my computer! I will have to find an alternative to this product. I thought it was bad enough that the one I got last year quit working, but this is ridiculous.

B0001YXWVO
Macally PS-AC4 AC Power Adapter for Apple G4
I bought this to use with my Apple PowerBook and it works perfectly. Apple's version of the same product is substantially more expensive. The only thing I miss is the little light on the cord indicating that the computer is charging. But I would recommend this over Apple's adapter based on price alone.

Macally PS-AC4 AC Power Adapter for Apple G4
The wire connecting to my computer on my last macally charger just fried after 13 months (i'll take the blame i could have been wrapping it too tightly), anyways it worked well and costed a fraction of the original so I figured I'd buy again, so I've purchased another. This newer one is a different design, no longer has the light on the brick, and the wire that connects to the computer is no longer disconnect-able.

B0001YXWVO

First, note that the adapter you'll get is NOT the one in the main photo--it is, however, the one pictured in the other submitted reader photos (with a beige, not grey, cord and the "macally" logo printed on the brick). The main difference is that the cord that goes from the adapter to the computer is NOT detachable, unlike the product that is pictured.It works perfectly fine with my Aluminum PowerBook G4 15". As has been noted, the main functional loss compared to the original is the lack of a charging indicator light. The adapter itself is actually lighter and more slender than the original, and appears durable so far. I can't imagine buying the Apple original adapter for twice the cost for a computer that's now several years old.

This AC adapter works great for me with my Apple 15" Aluminum G4 Powerbook. Apple still wants to charge an insane price for this last-generation power supply, but luckily Macally has a solution that is almost as nice for about half the price.It does not light up to indicate that it is charging (which is too bad, it was a nice touch).

After buying two overpriced Apple original adapters that couldn't reach 6 months of use because they broke, I was determined to get me another brand for less money.This Macally seemed the right choice, price was correct and the design was acceptable... But like I said in the title: Almost a good item, except fot one detail- This was supossed to be 65w and mine delivers 50w!!!! I still can use this but the battery takes almost an entire day to be complete full, and if the battery runs all the way down and you conect the adapter hoping to continue working you can't! The 50w are not enough to wake up the computer immediately after the battery was drained completely, you have to wait like 10 to 15 minutes to the battery to recharge a bit and then it wakes up.My advice: buy this adapter and not apple original rip-off! But be aware this adapter is not perfect and has issues.

B0001YXWVO
Macally PS-AC4 AC Power Adapter for Apple G4
I bought two of these in the last year and a half; one to keep with me when I travel and one to leave at home (replaced the original one from Apple). I loved these! They were the same model number as the one I ordered in the last month. I had to buy another one b/c I dropped one of mine once too often. I plugged in the new one, and it started charging, but then it started going on and off and the screen was dimming back and forth. The battery indicator kept going from charging to discharging. I didn't think that this could be good on the computer and/or battery. I closed the lid, left it to charge overnight (thinking I had drained the battery too much) and it charged the battery, but again, once I had discharged the battery about 25% and tried it again, it surged again. I ordered another one and sent the first one back and it did the same thing. I really disappointed....the charger looks different than my first ones, but it looks sturdier and better. Why doesn't it work the same?

I bought this power cord to replace my original Apple cord that lasted almost three years. This one works fine, though it might charge the battery more slowly than the Apple brand charger did, or I could be imagining it. It isn't as easy to pack up as the Apple charger and I do miss the little orange light that tells me it's charging. The only serious gripe I have is that it makes an annoying high pitched buzzing sound when it's charging. But overall it does what it's supposed to do and it's a lot cheaper than the Apple cord. And, if you look at the 200+ reviews on Apple's website, the Apple charger for iBook G4 gets only one out of five stars because it tends to break after very little use. After reading all those reviews I consider myself lucky that mine lasted as long as it did. Since I've only had this charger for about a month and haven't really given it a chance to prove its durability it gets 3 stars.

I'd expect as much from a third-party product: this power adapter worked perfectly for 20 months, then over the course of 7 days it sputtered off and on, then it completely burned out on me. There was no wear-and-tear or cosmetic damage to the cables. It just stopped working.Pros::+ Long cable+ Two-prong plug (in case you have nothing but older outlets at your place)Cons::+ constant blue 'charge' light doesn't change color to indicate full charge, and is bright enough to act as a flashlight in dark rooms+ Unexpected, complete failure after 20 months!I can see why this is a popular, cheaper alternative to Apple's expensive cord. Reason I got it was the Apple's original cord twisted out and broke at the laptop end, and even that was after 24 months of use. So if you're not ready to pay Apple prices for power supplies, perhaps buy two of the MacAlly cords to prepare for the 'inevitable'. Inexpensive enough to warrant such a purchase.Then again, Apple power supplies are currently MagSafe type, so whenever you upgrade, you'll have two power cords that won't work with MagSafe laptops. Bottom line, I just barely got my money's worth with this power adapter. You get what you pay for.

Well the first thing to say is this: the picture on Amazon is NOT the adapter you receive. And the description is false as well! First of all, the real adapter is white, not grey. Second, the real adapter is composed of only 2 pieces, not 3 as pictured. With the real one you cannot detach the section of cord that runs from the computer to the brick. This was one of the reasons I bought this one, as I thought that the ability to totally separate all the cords and coil them up separately would help it last longer. My previous Apple power adapter shorted out where the thin cord meets the brick.Third, there is NO LED power light anywhere on this thing (as stated in the item description) and shown in the photo.Now it DOES work, which is great, but I'm quite ticked that the advertising is so false and misleading. I have been meaning to call Amazon about this, but I need my laptop for school and can't really afford to return this and be left without a laptop for a week.

This unit works very well and is a bargain compared to the Apple replacement adapter. I wish it had the really cool indicator light that Apple's does, but for the price, just learn to check your charge status at the top of your screen. I like that this unit comes in two pieces- don't use the the "lock" mechanism, so when you trip over the power cord like I do, a lot, it will come apart at the charger-end instead of damaging the connector at the computer-end.

I am on my third cord, after returning it twice (within one year!). This cord doesn't charge consistently, and so it makes your screen flicker, and music and videos skip. You have to fiddle with the cord for 10 minutes to even get it to charge at all sometimes. Believe me, it's not worth the lower cost for this - just get a more expensive one that actually works.

I've now been through three of these cords. they seem to last around a year before just dying. The first two eventually had fatal connection issues with the piece that connects to the computer, however my third one has just died and is actually not getting any power from the wall. The little indicator just fades out, and now won't come on at all. Yes it's a lot cheaper than the other cords, but I'm just not sure its better. I know lots of people have problems with the apple cords as well.

This isn't powerful enough to use the computer when battery is low. Need to let low battery charge for 10 or 15 minutes before I can use the computer.

This power adapter charges my 17" Powerbook G4 excruciatingly slowly and, now 6 months after purchase, it doesn't always even charge.Flakey charging issue: Recently, I have to keep unplugging and replugging from the middle block to get power to the computer! So now I guess I'm going to have to buy a new Apple power adapter for approximately $80.Slow charge issue: My computer gets down to about 80% charged and it can take a couple of hours to power back to 100% (while I'm using it). I'm wondering if it charges more slowly because the cord that goes into the wall has two prongs instead of three. ??? I never had problems charging quickly with the Apple brand.

Bought one. Price great. Shipped fast. Works fine. Good quality construction and design. I see other reviewers whining here. Keep in mind the p/s is the most unreliable part of a laptop, for many reasons. It takes the brunt of all power surges for the computer, it has the most electrical current flow, etc. If Apple could make one that was indestructible we would not even be here looking or buying these at all and the replacement ones would not exist. For us, this unit was recommended at the Apple store, and for good reason. No worries. Get one.

Tengo una powerbook 15" a&ntilde;o 2005 platinum. Lo compre con reservas, ya que una bater&iacute;a gen&eacute;rica que compr&eacute; a mi laptop termin&oacute; por derretirme el cablecito de mi cargador Mac original. Sin embargo debe afirmar que el cargador funciona correctamente, ha cargado la bater&iacute;a gen&eacute;rica relativamente r&aacute;pido (no tanto como la bataeria original y el cargador original) y su extensi&oacute;n es c&oacute;moda, suficientemente larga como para trabajar en cualquier superficie lejos de un enchufe (2 mts.). Se calienta un poco, pero no llega a ser muy intenso el calor, ni aun cuando se est&aacute; trabajando y cargando al mismo tiempo. Lo que si no hace, no se si por la bater&iacute;a o porque no da la suficiente corriente es trabajar conectado con una bater&iacute;a mac original completamente descargada, lo que s&iacute; hac&iacute;a el cargador original. Es decir, si reemplazo la bater&iacute;a gen&eacute;rica por la vieja que ya no agarra carga, el cargador no funciona. Saludos

You aren't saving any being this adapter. I purchased this for a 12" G4 Powerbook. The power it supplies goes on and off constantly. This can't be good for the computer. It certainly doesn't charge it. Don't waste your money on this Macally adapter. Try to find an original Apple adapter if you can.

I think it's more flimsy than the Apple AC Adapter and so I question its ability to hold up to typical use in the long term. Even so, it's half the price, S leaves it at the office (so it's not travelling around) and it'll probably do fine. At half the price of the Apple AC Adapter, it seems like a good deal.

I had to replace the Apple adapter that came with my laptop and this is a sturdy and relatively cheap alternative to buying another Apple one. Of course, it's not as aesthetically pleasing and it doesn't have the convenient green/orange indicator light, but it does it's job. I haven't had any problems with it. I recommend it highly.

I've plowed through 7 of Apple's OEM power adapters between my iBook and my PowerBook. While the OEM adapters are cute and stylish, they last a max of 6 mos before they break and potentially cause a fire in your house.I've had the MacAlly adapter for all of 24 hours and I LOVE IT. It does lack a bit in design...(see other's reviews) but in the end isn't it the sturdiness of the part that we should be concerned with? A+++

The Macally powerbook adapter has been great for me and my 2 daughters, whose Apple powercords have broken several times. So far, so good. Every now and then my computer seems to get overheated, but I'm not sure exactly what is causing that. I've had mine at least 6 months and it's been fine.

After going through two of Apple's poorly made power cords for my 12" PowerBook in a time span of three years, I knew it was time to get a third party power cord. The Macally power cord is simply awesome. It is is built sturdier than the Apple power cord, and best of all, it was less than half the price (Apple power cords cost you a hefty $80). The only minute problem I've noticed with this power cord is that from time to time (and it is not very often), my PowerBook will make a "charging" and "uncharging" noise. Usually I just have to fiddle with the part of the cord that plugs into the adapter, and it stops. Other than that, it's a fantastic purchase, and I recommend it to any one who is fed up with Apple's poorly made cords.

Who needs Mac accessories when you can have an equally good (or better) product like Macally powerbook Ibook ac adapter? I purchased this item for my daughter when her Mac-made original AC adapter connection frayed and was not fixable. We tried to get a replacement at Mac retail stores and Mac on-line, but everyone was out of them and did not know when they would be available. This made me think that the original cords must have been somewhat defective since there was such a demand for them. We turned to Amazon to order the Macally AC adapter with some trepidation because the price was lower than the Mac-made product. That was several months ago and the Macally adapter has worked perfectly and we are very pleased with our purchase. I would recommend this product to anyone who needs a new adapter and because of the lower price, would advise it instead of the Mac.

If you're willing to trade a little style for some substance and save some money in the bargain, this is a very recommendable device. My Apple PowerBook power supply died in what is apparently typical fashion - sparking, crumbling wire where it meets the brick - and none of the Apple stores or CompUSAs in Atlanta had any in stock (which is curious in itself). I resorted to Amazon and decided to try this one out and I've been pretty happy with it. It seems sturdily constructed, and the breakaway cable is a surprisingly handy way to save on tangles. I do miss the plug-in charging light, but that's about it.

I was hesitant about purchasing this product after reading some of the reviews but I decided to take a chance and get it anyway. I'm glad I did!!!

I would definitely recommend this adapter to anyone who is looking to replace their apple power adapter.

I've had this replacement adapter for nearly a month now with much hesitation at the beginning. Like many of the other reviews have stated, the power connection indicator at the top of my iBook G4 would alternate between power supply and battery supply, causing a very annoying flicker of the screen. That has since stopped and now when the adapter is plugged in, it charges as normal (i.e. allowing me to utilize my computer while it charges).When the initial flicker of the screen started at the beginning, the iBook would only charge if I put it in sleep mode and closed the screen. I'm not sure what I've done differently since the problem has stopped so I'm not sure where to give advice as far as recommending this product. Simply "Buyer Beware".

This adaptor and Apple's adaptor are not going to live long. They are all pretty worthless, except for the fact that you HAVE TO HAVE ONE.I just buy the cheapest 65 watt adaptors I can find (for both 15" iBook G4 and 17" PowerBook G4) and plan to replace them within 6 months. Every now and then I find them for $20 - 40.00, and buy 2 to 4 at a time. Next time I'll buy a new laptop with the magnetic plug! Am very disappointed in Apple. I love my Mac, but quality is definitely going down.

When my Mac Powerbook G4's cord started going on the fritz a year and a half after I had gotten my laptop, I wasn't sure what to do. Since the Macbook has replaced the Powerbook, Apple no longer sells the adapter. And to get the adapter online was really expensive. When I found this option, I was thrilled. It has worked perfectly since the day I got it. It is sturdier than the Apple adapter, and so I feel it will last longer. Also, it is white, like many of the Apple adapters, so if you're worried about the aesthetics of your computer, this option is a good one. I highly recommend this product!Macally PS-AC4 AC Power Adapter for Apple G4

The Macally version isn't as snazzy as the original Apple adapter, but it does its job pretty well -- and for a lot less -- with one minor hitch.The Macally version seems to be a battery charger only -- if there is no battery in the computer, for example, you can't use this as a power supply. I confirmed this with both my PowerBook G4 1.67 and my iBook Dual USB, both of which use the same power adapter. It's not a problem for me, but if you are planning to run your laptop without a battery (or with one that is "out of juice"), be advised this may not work in that capacity.It follows that if you let the battery run completely out, you will have to plug the computer in for about 15 minutes before you are able to resume use. The Apple adapter lets you resume use immediately.If neither of these are issues for you, the adapter works great and I would recommend this as a good value.

I ordered this product after, like many others, my iBook adapter suddenly stopped working. Also like many others, I was unwilling to pay the exorbitant price that Apple charges for a replacement adapter. The price was right for this product and it works perfectly. It's white color and blue LED lend it a pretty nice appearance, and it matches my iBook just fine. Granted, it may not be as stylish as Apple's charger, but I'm willing to give up a little glowing green and orange ring at the tip for a product that is affordable and reliable. A bonus is that the power brick for this charger does not get anywhere near as hot as Apple's. A welcome change, seeing as Apple's original adapter reached pretty scorching temperatures at times. The price Apple charges for their adapter because of style is outrageous. Therefore, that aspect was less of a factor for me here. 5 stars for the combination of quality and affordability,

I have purchased three of these adapters and they work well. They will charge a G4 Powerbook while the unit is running.

I bought this adapter for my 12-inch G4 powerbook, one of the computers listed as compatible with this AC adapter. The specs all match up and it SHOULD work. But it didn't. The power would fluctuate and the computer would go back and forth between AC power and battery power, making the screen flicker and the battery never charged. I contacted MacAlly and they said they're aware of the problem but don't have a solution. Their answer to the problem was to return it, which I did.If even MacAlly admits it doesn't work, they really shouldn't keep selling it. All I can do is say don't buy this AC adapter.

WONDERFUL PRODUCT - BEST ON MARKET! I cannot tell you all how much I like EVERY Macally Product I own. As an avid Mac user ever since computers were born, I've always stood by Apple Products UNTIL both my G3 iBook and PowerBook Cords - because of the cheap and inferior design, became weak at the point of highest impact and - well, both cords shorted out within the first year and one of the cords actually shot sparks and flames into the air. If I had not been right there to see it, I would not have believed it - yet, I am sure the Fire Department would have. I would have had my entire home in flames as I was working on a large project with flammables everywhere - I was VERY LUCKY! The US Product Safety Commission hasn't done anything to help - I filed reports, and Apple is acutely aware of the problem, (they recalled the G4 cords I believe, not the G3 cords. I still have the singed/burned cords as proof.) Do yourself a favor - watch this around children and pets - and in the meantime - invest $30-$40 for a cord that has lasted me three years and is still going strong. I can't find them locally in Boston, they are always sold out, everywhere. That alone tells you something! Replace your cord before you have a fire - or it shorts out your computer - the surge supressor won't stop it. I love the Macally Price, the solid quality, the compact nature and again, the PRICE. APPLE wanted approx. $100 for another cheap flammable cord. I ALMOST became a Windows user over this, but Macally changed my mind - do not hesitate to buy this gem, or the USB 2.0 mini dock for those iPod users with a 1.0 USB port - I have had my investment returned many times over, and do not need additional FIRE INSURANCE for home now that I have a Macally AC Cord! Buy one before you have a problem! Forget any help from Apple. And - if your original cord is showing wear, or you are losing your charge - those were my first warnings - don't risk your home, or family. It happened to me and I am afraid for those who don't know what happened to me and MANY others! (PS: Tried Kensington at $79.00 and it fell out constantly - improper fit, another waste of $$$)

My original power adapter gave up the ghost after about two years. With a replacement costing $80 I was motivated to try this adapter. At first it appeared more durable and I only missed the lighted rim of the original a little bit. After about a year and a half the Macally adapter has started to go out (it no longer connects well where the cable from the laptop meets the transformer).At less than half the cost of the Apple product and with few other options I'm buying another. It's the best option I can find. My Powerbook is going strong into year five but it's doing so on its third adapter.

This is a good replacement for the Apple Charger. Only a couple of notes to make.1. The blue light doesn't indicate whether the notebook is charging or not, only if the cord is plugged into the outlet. This means that you can't really tell what is going on unless you open your laptop and make sure the indicator is showing that it is charging.2. If you drain your battery fully, so your laptop goes to sleep BE WARNED... You will not be able to plug it in and resume working right away. I had to plug it in and let it charge up for a good while before I could operate my Powerbook again, pulling power to operate the computer and charge the battery. This has been most annoying.Other than those weird gripes, it is a sufficient power adapter.

I went looking for an alternative to the stylish, cleverly designed, but expensive OE Apple powerbrick AC adapter when mine started showing signs of plug wear (flickering of the ring light at the connection to the computer). I had wanted one for a while anyway, so I could keep one at home and one at my office, thus shortening my daily packing-up time and (I hoped) prolonging the life of the equipment through fewer coiling/uncoiling cycles. I was pleased to find the MacAlly product, which cost less than half as much and appeared to fill the need. I read that its power output was slightly lower; frankly, I can't tell the difference. It charges my Powerbook G4 just fine. I miss the ring light on the plug keeping me apprised of charging progress (I now have to check the battery status indicator in the OSX taskbar) and it lacks the Apple adapter's ability to plug right into the wall, so most of the time I have more cord than I need. Other than that, no problems. Good product, great price.

This adapter is better than I expected. My original Apple adapter's cable got cut near the joint after a year's use, so I was looking for a cheaper alternative. I was worried whether it would work for my 12" G4 Aluminium Powerbook. Its power ratings are not exactly the same as the original 45W Apple adapter. It is rated at 24V, but at 2A instead of 1.875A. So its actually 48W (24*2) rather than a 45W (24*1.875) adapter. It actually charges my 12" Pbook slightly faster. I guess the 15" Pbooks are actually 65W, so I'm not sure how fast it charges those. Anyway, this adapter is light and the power cords are thicker than Apple's. It costs less than half the original.The white brick is very light and there is a locking mechanism on the cable from the brick to the laptop. I wish the cable on the other end was more flexible. I didnt notice any sparks when I plugged it in, whereas my original Apple adapter always sparked and sputtered. There is no light indicating charge status, but that doesn't bother me much. Although it says G4 Titanium powerbook, it seems to also work with the Aluminium powerbooks. I wish Apple made design changes to its flawed adapter. They are only enabling third parties like Macally survive :).

Many positive reviews seem to indicate that this charger works handsomely for some folks and some laptops. It did not, however, work for me or my 12" Aluminum Powerbook G4. Prior to purchase I visited the MacAlly website and found this line regarding compatibility:"AC adaptor works with G3 iBook and G4 PowerBook only"I assumed that my PowerBook G4 would fit under the definition of a "G4 PowerBook" and proceeded with my purchase. The adapter arrived quickly and smartly packaged, but when connected it would continuously cycle between charging and not charging or connected and disconnected. This seemed to be the case even when the laptop was powered off, but was particularly apparent when the laptop was running as it would cycle between full and 3/4 screen brightness and the charge indicator would bounce between "charging" and "calculating (ie running from battery) status. When I contacted MacAlly via email about this I received this marginally helpful response:---------------------------------------Dear Customer,Thank you for contacting us.If the adapter you purchased does not have a blue LED light on the white Brickbox, it may have charging problem with 12" PowerBook G4.Please return to your vendor and buy another brand charger for 12" Powerbook G4 if this is possible.Sincerely,Michael Huang, Tech SupportMacally USA4601 E. Airport Dr.Ontario, CA 91761---------------------------------------I replied, attempting to clarify that he was essentially instructing to buy from someone else. And received the following "clarification."---------------------------------------Dear Customer,Thank you for contacting us.Clearly put, this adapter is designed for powerbook G3 and G4 series, no problem about it.Recently we have received some feedbacks, just for 12" screen size PowerBook G4 only, that some 12" powerbook G4 (not all of them) might exists some powering flickering issue between charging and battery. Currently we are still under the investigation phase for the cause for this issue.Customers who had bought this AC adapter with eligible warranty can mail the adapter back to our company for us to duplicate their scenario to troubleshoot the cause. ( powerbook model, operating system version,etc.) For those customer who are in dire need for such adapter, if it is possible, they can contact the vendor for return or exchange for another brand which is working problem-free with powerbook 12". Either way will do.Please advise.Sincerely,Michael Huang, Tech SupportMacally USA---------------------------------------So, I can return the charger to MacAlly for "troubleshooting." But no mention of repair/replacement/refund and some vague hinting that perhaps the charger does not work with the range of laptops that they claim.Ultimately this charger may provide a good value for some, but seems to be somewhat particular; even above and beyond the well covered 65W-45W distinction. Lastly, MacAlly did not provide a particularly satisfying customer support experience.

This unit is only 48W. The original Apple part (A1021) is 65W. The result is that a full charge for my iBook is 7Hrs rather than 3-4. Check the wattage of your original adapter. Watts = DC Volts * DC Amps. Otherwise quality is good.

My Apple charger broke (big surprise), and I obviously needed to replace it. Not for 80 bucks, though. I ended up with the Macally adapter since I've had friends recommend their stuff in the past. While this charger lacks the whole hip Apple design thing, it more than makes up for it with function and solid construction. It's also nice and compact so it's easy to take on the go.My one quibble is that the main photo shows a white brick with gray cords and what appears to be an indicator light to show the charger is connected to an outlet. When I got mine, the cords were white (a plus), but there was no indicator light (a minus). In fact, that's how it appears in the user photos.The lack of that indicator light is the only reason I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 (I know, I'm picky). All in all, it's still a great product. It charges my 15" Powerbook in 1-2 hours depending on my use, and it feels like it has a sturdy build.

Recently purchased this. It charges my powerbook G4 intermittently, charging up and stopping every 2 seconds. Very annoying and not helpful at all. Couldn't charge the battery of my computer up. Also, it makes a buzzing sound every time it "charged" for the 2 seconds. Maybe mine was faulty, but I would rather find another brand than exchange it for another one. I'd put zero stars, but you can't put up a review without one.I instead, bought a BTI (brand) charger. Many people will give a bad review without giving you an alternative or solution then. I recommend the BTI powerbook charger. You can find it on Amazon for CHEAPER than the Macally by searching "Battery Technology AC Adapter for Notebooks (PS-MC-G4)". It cost me $27.84 instead of $33.24. Not a huge difference in money, but there is a huge difference in performance. The BTI charger works quite well and doesn't heat up badly. FINALLY AN ADPATER THAT WORKS WELL! I've had 2 apple adapters, a Macally, and now the BTI. Try the BTI.

This is a solid, and affordable replacement for the apple AC Power Adapter. If you've got a late model iBook or PowerBook, you can't go wrong with this device.

I bought one of these adapters about a year ago to replace the original apple charger that came with my ibook G4. The Macally worked fine for about a year then died; since it lasted as long as the pricier apple one, I decided to go ahead and get another one. The new adapter - which is listed as exactly the same product I bought the first time - is physically different, and I think is not really compatible with the ibook G4; the charger doesn't always connect firmly to the laptop. And it could be a coincidence, but in the month since I have had it my computer has started having sudden power failures when running off a/c power (but has no problems running off battery). I guess I will be shelling out for the apple adapters in future - this one seems too risky.

You'd think for such a high-end, costly "entry-level" laptop, buying a replacement part would be affodable. This isn't the case with the apple ibooks. The cords which seem prone to damage and breaking down, are $80.00 to replace if you go to Apple. That's a lot of money for a cord that will in all probability break in around 8 months.The Macally is a great alternative - it's a lot cheaper and has been very, very durable. The one drawback is that it doesn't light up the side of your laptop (red when charging, green when charged). Other that than, it's great! Good purchase for me.

Tired of being ripped off by Apple for replacement parts? Considering that we pay more to begin with for their products, you think they'd give us a break. But nooooo!Thank you MacAlly for having a replacement AC adapter that doesn't cost $79. I've had it for several weeks now, and it works great. It isn't pretty, but it gets the job done. If your iBook/Power Book AC adapter has died, get this one!!

I read reviews of this product before I bought it that mentioned that it makes a high pitched sound. I figured these reviewers probably had defective adapters. However, mine also makes a high pitched sound. It doesn't do it all the time, but I worry that as it gets older, the sound will get worse. Although it charges my computer fine, if I could do it over again, I might pay the extra money and get a different brand...unless you don't mind high pitched noises.

I am about to buy my 3rd one of these. Each one has lasted about 6-9 months, while an apple charger lasts about 8-12 for the amount of use I put into it. So for my money, I like to buy one of these every 6 months for $30, rather then drop $80 on the apple brand.

I'm very happy with this adaptor. It is more durable than the Apple adaptor, and it seems to expand longer too. It's white and matches my iBook G4 well. It does not have a little green light ring to indicate that it's being charged, but you can see your battery status on your computer's menu anyway. Personally, I found the green light on the Mac adaptor a bit annoying anyway.

This charger is much sturdier than the mac version (which my cat chewed through in a matter of days). I'd read another review that said this adapter didn't work on the aluminum PowerBooks, but it works great for mine. In addition, the product arrived in about one day. I ordered it on a Friday morning and received it on Saturday before noon. I would highly reccomend this product.

I have an 'old' ibook from 2001, white, and even though it says for G4 on the package of the charger, it works just fine with mine. I actually like it better than the original one from Mac, smaller and somewhat handier. Glad I didn't have to pay 80$ to fix that ! :-)

I purchased this unit to replace the one that came with my PowerBook that had work out. The cord is much longer and the unit has given me no problems. I do recommend this as a replacement over the Mac's power supply.As a side note, the unit that I received did not have an LED indicator.

Bought this about a month ago as a back-up adaptor. When used on my Powerbook G4 and my wife's iBook G4, it does not charge them when in operation. It supplies power so that the units are functional when plugged in, but it will only charge the units when they are closed or turned off. I'd give this a one star, but at least it powers them when they're on, even without the charging.

This product works well, with no problems so far. I have now had it for about a month, and it keeps my iBook G4 running with no issues. It doesn't have the light that indicates whether power is being received, but that's a minor thing. Also doesn't have the easy-to-use cable-wrapping things on the original, but once again, that's a mere quibble. All in all, I am satisfied with this purchase.

This is a good replacement for my original power supply. Good buy for the price but I miss the charging light on the plug on the computer end of the cable.

Soon after I purchased and we bagan using the Macally Powerbook a/c adapter /charger for my wife's G3 iBook, the cooling fan started running at warp speed. The fan would turn off when the cover was closed. We have switch back to the old "mac" charger and the fan is still very loud!

Excellent design. Its the first adapter that actually allows both cords to separate from the power unit. Most of the prior adapters that I've thrown away was because the Mac plug got bent or crushed rendering the whole unit useless. With this design, it just requires a new wire.

The OEM part should be more durable. This is something you shouldn't have to replace. Apple really dropped the ball on that one. You buy a laptop for $1000-$3000 and you get a POS power adapter. I know 2 other iBook or Powerbook owners who had to replace their power adapter AT LEAST once. This one is great, and you can't beat the price.

For some reason if my powerbook completely runs down, attaching the power cord does not allow me to immediately turn back on the computer, unlike the apple cord. Do not know why this is, but this 3 - 5 minute lag time between plugging and "playing" is a real pain. Other than that, the cord seems to work fine.

I'm sure this product is great for G4 Powebooks and G3 iBooks, but nowhere in this product description does it say that this adapter is NOT for use with iBook G4s. I tried this on my iBook G4, and the computer kept switching back and forth between battery power and the power supply from the adapter. I'm returning this to Amazon tomorrow, but am upset that I wasted $20 overnighting this adapter because I absolutely need to use my computer this weekend. I wish they would update the product description to make it explicit that this is for Powerbook G4s and iBook G3s ONLY.

You can read all the other reviews; I found them very helpful. I use this on my 12" Aluminum PowerBook G4, 1.5GHz, 1.25 mb RAM. My only comment has to do with the difference in wattage between the Apple 65W rating and this charger's 45W. The lower wattage results in a longer battery charge time. Plus, if you operate the laptop when the battery is dead (plugged in, of course), the computer continually searches for the best power source, switching back and forth between battery and plug-in. This causes the screen to flicker between high and low brightness. When this happens, I let the battery get fully charged before using the laptop.

Look carefully at the pictures for this product. The initial picture, without the brand name and with a blue LED light, is the product that works on iBook G4. The customer photos show a completely different product, one that is not recommended for use on iBook G4. I did not receive the product in the initial picture, but thankfully I noticed this before I opened the package (the package says iBook G3) and I called the support line. They said I had not received the right product and could not guarantee that the product would work correctly --or at all, so I ordered a replacement through Amazon. Still, I did not get the right product. Amazon told me they would stop selling this product as there is a problem with what is being shipped. I got my money back and went to our local Mac 2nd party store to find something reliable for the G4.

I'm now on my third charger for my Powerbook (my dad says I'm rough on equipment). Let me tell you, the Macally is NOT it. Like others, it fluctuates between charging and battery every 1-2 seconds and the brick makes weird squeaky noises. After not having a computer for a week and being so relived to finally get this charger, I was almost in tears to find that it is a piece of crap. It charges when the computer is off or in sleep mode, but that's not going to cut it. If you have a Powerbook G4, don't waste your money on this.

I bought this charger thinking that it would be compatible with my late 2005 iBook G4. The description page has nothing stating that it is not for ibook G4 but only for Powerbook G4 and ibook G3. Also, after only about 3 weeks of use the charger died completely. This is by far the worst charger I have ever had. Pros: quick ship Cons: incorrect description, lack of durability

Ordered this item in October 2008, as my original iBook power adapter had developed a short. The first Macally adapter I received powered the computer fine, but as soon as I let the battery deplete and expected the adapter to charge the battery, it failed. It would alternately go on and off (the power icon in the menu bar indicated this, toggling between "powered" and "battery only" every second or so), and the white brick was making odd clicking noises.Returned it. Received a replacement. Same problem - as soon as it needed to charge the battery, the adapter failed. I gave up, asked for a refund, and purchased an Apple charger instead (with only a failing adapter for power, I was not inclined to give the Macally adapter a third try).I should also note that the "new" design for this item does NOT match the photo shown here: the power brick is hard wired to the cord that goes into the laptop (the power cord is still separate, but it fits nice and snugly), the wires are white (not gray), and there is no LED indicator.

Considerably less feeble or dangerous than the Mac adapter. Works pretty well, but not quite as powerful as the mac one, so it takes a little longer to charge up the battery. Really the only frustration is that when my battery is completely run out, I have to keep the laptop closed for about 15-20 minutes while it charges. Essentially there needs to be some charge in the battery for the adapter to get a foothold, or else it's not powerful enough to charge and run the computer at the same time. But overall for the money and (so far) reliability, I'll take this over the Mac adapter, which would have burned down my dorm if i hadn't been in the room and noticed it was starting to smoke.

I had to buy this as a replacement for the power adapter that came with my PowerBook G4. Unfortunately that adapter was so poorly constructed that it began to break and fray within half a year. It quickly became a fire hazard and then broke.This power adapter is much better. The plastic coating the wires is much thicker and sturdier than the Apple adapter. The power cord is at least twice as long as the one that came with my PowerBook. It doesn't have the goofy "features" on the apple adapter, like a flippy plug at the end, but that was part of what made the original one so prone to breakage! It also doesn't pulsate like the Apple adapter, but personally I always found that distracting anyway.I have been using it for quite some time now and it still works great. I'm very happy with it!

I have been very unhappy with this product because it:1) makes a high pitched buzz2) intermittently stops providing enough power causing my computer to constantly switch back and forth between battery and wall power.3) the cord is difficult to wrapI'll be trying to return it through the warranty process, but I wish I had just coughed up the [lots of] extra money to buy an Apple one.

The main gripe I've had with my wonderful ibook I purchased several years ago had to do with the powercord. The Apple power cord that came with it wore out very quickly in contrast to any power cord in my life of memories, and was, to my mind, and apparently the mind of others who have purchased the great Macally AC Adaptor, very overpriced for something that needed to be replaced frequently.I replaced the power cord twice before I had enough of it all. Finding that it would take me 1-3 weeks to order an Apple cord again, I decided to check into alternatives. Spent a ridiculously long time on the phone with one of the major outlets that handle Mac equipment only to have them screw up my order on a cosmically absurd level (they had invoiced me for a very expensive flat screen television, which was perhaps reverse psychology - the Apple plug did seem suddenly not so expensive in comparison :)Ultimately found that the outlet neither had the cord that would work with my Mac ibook with a G3 processor nor did they know what kind of cord did (this took about an hour for them to deduce, even when they had invoiced me for an alternative plug.Finally I turned to my heroes at Amazon, read a few reviews on the Apple cord (generally pretty scary) and was directed to this Macally.I LOVE it. It's a little less compact than the Apple cord and does not have the light that indicates that it is charging to the computer, but it's about 1/2 the price of those infernal Apple cords and I am happy. Highly recommended. Thanks, Amazon!

I purchased one of these guys back in May of '05 and it worked alright. I had to keep an eye on the battery status on screen, due to the lack of orange/green lights telling me when it's charged.After a few months it died on me, due to a lack of connection between the cable that plugs into the computer and the box with the blue LED on it. Their tech support was challenging to communicate with and had to be done by e-mail due to my inability to find a phone number for them. After about 5 exchanges, I FedExed them the defective unit and recieved a brand new one within the next couple weeks. The current one is working just fine.In summary: not a bad product for the price (sure beats Apple's frail wires), but customer service is a bear.

Well, it was a good deal and seemed to work well for a month! But after the stated time it quit. I noticed that the charging/battery guage on the tool bar was flickering back and forth and noticed a quiet humming sound coming from the power adapter. Since I live in Eastern Europe and someone brought this here from the US for me to use as a second adapter (to use at work) it will be hard to return. Maybe it was a fluke, but now I'm down to the original adapter and no backup. Hope you have better luck.

I have been through two of these, each one only worked for a few months before going bad. After three months and only sporadic use, the first one I bought started cycling on-off continuously. This isn't apparent unless you are using it while plugged in, but the battery icon will show it is charging for a couple of seconds, then flip back to the battery icon for a couple of seconds and so on. I contacted the company, which confirmed it was faulty, so I sent it back to them for replacement. I received the replacement from Macally and after a couple of months, the second one started doing the same thing. I have read this is a pretty common occurrence with this product. I suppose there is a reason that it's a third the cost of the Apple product.

Wow there is a lot of love it or hate it on the reviews. Some people seem to be receiving something other than the Macally product. The Macally product comes in an orange package and is spec'd for Powerbook G4 and ibook G3. ... It works fine on my ibook G4. It's white and matches the ibook. It works fine for me and I do not see any of the reported switching between charge and battery like others have reported. My onscreen battery indicator says it's on charge all the time just like it should be. I put 2 pictures of the Macally product with my ibook G4 in the customer photo section.Here's an update. .. Mine lasted 11 months. As another reviewer pointed out, the Macally PS-AC4 that Amazon is shipping has 48 watt output. The original Apple 14" G4 ibook power supply has 65 watt output. So the Macally product is just barely able to push enough power to run a G4 ibook. That would also be a contributing factor to all of the early failures that are reported.If you hit the Macally web site and search PS-AC4 you will see that it is officially specified to work with G3 i-book. I don't have one, but maybe the G3 draws less power than a G4 ibook, so 48 watt output might work fine for a G3.For some reason it is specified to also work with a G4 Powerbook. Does that draw less power than a G4 ibook? Not sure. All I know is it died after 11 months. I tried to warranty it with macally. They asked exactly what system I was using it with. When I said iBook G4, my warranty was immediately voided. .. So keep that in mind if you are communicating with Macally.Since my warranty was voided, I cracked it open to see what is inside. I'll put those pictures up. It is made by unifive. Their name is printed all over the circuit board and even molded into the back of the plastic case underneath the silver sticker.

My Apple charger broke and I needed to buy a new one. Thinking it was ridiculous to spend $80 on a charger, I went with this Macally charger. I read most of the reviews here on Amazon, including the one and two star reviews from people who said the charger didn't work and, when plugged in, oscillated between charging and not charging the computer. I figured they might have received a dud and decided to try my luck anyhow. I have now received two of these items from Amazon both with the same problem. When I plugged it in and was using the computer at the same time, the power oscillated between charging and not charging every second or two. When I put the computer to sleep or turned it off, it seemed to charge the computer. Anyhow, after having the same problem twice, I decided to shell out the bucks for an actual Apple charger instead of having to deal with the annoying charger and keep sending them back and forth to Amazon.I do believe, however, that this charger fried my computer's battery. After using this product a few times, hoping I could get it to work, the battery meter would read 70% charged but the computer would just shut down because, in reality, it was not charged. The guy at the Apple store said that I would have to replace my battery eventually but that the charger probably helped speed that process along.Anyhow, I am now poorer from having to purchase both an Apple charger AND a new battery, but now I'm happy that I can actually use my laptop! I would not recommend this product to anyone not only for the inconvenience of having to deal with a faulty product but also because it can actually mess with your laptop.On a side note, Amazon returns were GREAT. Very efficient...I have not had any problems with them. They even sent me the replacement product before I had a chance to mail back the first one. Something I was not expecting at all.

A replacement adapter for my 4-year-old G4 Powerbook was going to cost $80 from Apple. The Macally adapter is less than half the price, and it's built like a tank -- the wires are thicker, and the plastic is more durable. The only thing you might miss is having the yellow/green charging light...but that's more of a luxury and not a necessity. Highly recommended.

I am a college student and I purchased this power adapter because my Apple adapter no longer works - the cord broke near the connector - big surprise, right. This was after 3 years. Anyway, I love this new one. It's only a week old now but I like how it looks - it's white and matches my iBook, and the cord is more substantial, but aesthetically, it is very nice and not huge or fragile looking. I thought I'd miss the light on the connector, but that's not the case - It fits snugly into the input and charges rather quickly. You really can't beat this one... even if it breaks 2 times and I replace it with a 3rd, I still haven't spent as much as I would on one of Apple's shoddy adapters. I say buy it.

I bought this because it was a cheaper alternative to Mac's (ridiculously priced)$80 charger. At first it worked pretty good, but about a week or two after i got it it seems to not be working like it should. i think there is some kind of warranty, so i should try and exchange it...but sometimes when it is plugged into my computer it will charge for one second, then stop for one second, charge for one second, stop for one second, etc. It still manages to charge the computer, but im not sure if all this on\off stuff is necessarily good for my computer...

This charger only lacks 1 feature from the Apple model: it lack's Apple's green & orange light around the charging tip. To me it's not a big loss, as the light on my Apple charger quit working 2 years ago.I've been using this charger on my 15" aluminum PowerBook G4 for months, and it has performed exceptionally. The brick does get a little warm, but so does Apple's. I actually prefer this charger over Apple's when traveling, as its longer cord is more functional in airports and hotel rooms. The cord is about the same length as Apple's charger with the extension cord installed, except that it weighs less than half as much and takes up less room in a laptop bag or backpack.I love having an extra charging cable at home so I don't have to play the plug/unplug game every time I move my laptop between rooms. And I prefer this one much more over Apple's when traveling. Highly recommend!

I bought this after the cable split open on my original AC adapter. This adapter may not have the color-changing indicator light on the end to let you see if your laptop is fully charged or still charging, but its construction is much better than the original adapter, and I don't expect it to split open like my old one did. The velcro strap attached to this adapter is also a much better way of wrapping and storing the cord than the plastic tabs on the original.

After my Apple adapter finally went to the big orchard in the sky, I was overwhelmed with grief coupled with the desire to not pay full price for its replacement. A quick trip to Amazon and some button mashing led me to an old ally (pun intended) Macally and the PS-AC4. Click. Purchase. Consumer joy. I would recommend this. True, it's not as aesthetically pleasing as Apple's OEM juicer, but hey, what is?

my mac charger broke recently and when i looked at the prices to replace it, i almost fainted. $75!!?! unbelievable for that piece of junk. so when i found this well-reviewed replacement on amazon, i decided to go for it. thank god i did. i could not be happier. it seems much more sturdy than the mac one. the cord is longer and has an attached velcro tab for shortening it if you need to. the plug-in doesn't glow like the mac one to tell you if it's fully charged or not, but who cares? just open your computer and look at the screen. it's really insignificant when you compare the price. i highly recommend this product.

My apple power cord frayed at the plug in site to the computer so I replaced it with the macally and have fallen in love with this one. I'll admit that I do miss the cool wrap-around-the-base feature of the Apple power adapter, but this one secures with velcro and is much higher quality. Not only does this power adapter have better length, but also does not get as hot as the base of Apple's. Definitely a great buy!

As with most of the others who have written reviews, the pin for my iBook cord had broken off. I ordered the Macally version to save some money and was a little scared it would not work. I am glad I was wrong! It charged up my iBook immediately and seems a lot sturdier than the Apple version.

I purchased this to have a spare at home - often taking office work home - and also because many people had so many bad experiences with the original power adapter from Mac. My original is now over 2 years old and it's been doing fine. I used the new one almost every night and so far (14 days) its working fine.

We got our PowerBook in July of 2003 and had to replace the Apple adapter twice. I finally got fed up with the flimsy cord and purchased this Macally PS-AC4 adapter and I am very happy with the quality of the product. We've been using this for months and the only complaint (which is why the 4 stars and not 5) is that we miss seeing the little light around the end of the cord that plugs into the PowerBook that indicates the charge status (the one that glows orange or green). I would highly recommend this replacement to anyone, as long as you can live without the status light. At this price, it is hands down a better alternative to the delivered cord.

I've had my Powerbook for almost 2 years now, and I've burnt TWO original Apple Powercords, they're $100.00 each, so, just decided to not go for the 3rd one and try this one, which has me really happy so far, not as weak as Apple, and pretty practical, no mention a lot cheaper. The Apple one was a little easier to roll up and put away, but considering pro's and con's, this one if definitely just BETTER.

I read the reviews on this site and noticed that some said they received the wrong product. After looking at mine i noticed i too had been slipped the Inspire adapter, not the Macally that i ordered (which is far superior to the cheap knock off). I have been trying to contact Clear AV but they are never available..am off to contact Amazon next.

Like the other reviewer mentioned, Clear AV sent the wrong adapter!! They sent the "inspire" brand adapter M8482.BEWARE!!!More importantly this adapter is rated at 65 watts (not 45). I don't think this would be healthy for your computer. I am starting the process of returning this item. I'll will write again if I have problems with the return. Luckily I discovered the disparity before hooking up my laptop. Not happy.Update: I obtained the "real" Macally adapter today. So far its great!!! I am using an old dual usb g3 ibook. So far so good! Regarding ClearAV (Amazon vendor), they sent a return authorization today. I hopeful I will get my refund soon.---When that happens, I'll adjust my ratings upward --- Thanks!

Please be sure when you order this product from Amazon that you are sent a Macally charger... I had initially ordered one, but there was a problem with the address they mailed it to, so they sent a second one. I ended up getting both... Both of them turned out to be Macally knock offs and wouldn't plug properly into my computer. Thankfully, I had ordered a second one from Maczone for our other computer and I was able to see that mine was different from that one. I double checked the receipt and packing form to make sure I hadn't made a mistake, and it had my product listed as the Macally PS-AC4 AC adapter. I hope that Amazon will fix this screw up...The Macally AC Power adapter gets 4 starsThe Cheap knock off that doesn 't fit gets Zero stars...

I plugged this item into my laptop and nothing happened. No power- nothing.When I unplugged this adapter the negative metal ring from the plug stayed lodged inside of my computer, I had to remove it with needle nose pliers.I had to call the company 5 times before getting a rep on the phone as I was continually placed in automated limbo for about 15 per call. The rep actually admitted to me that this happens alot because the rings are too small and fit to tight in the computers.I was really looking forward to saving some dough. But this adapter was surprisingly worse the the original that came with the computer.They are sending me return authorization.

Was an affordable alternative to Apple's and generally works well, but the connector to the computer isn't secure. I'll be typing along and get a battery warning and have to jiggle the cord to recharge. Still, came at a better price than Apple's and I got what I paid for.

This Macally is the 3rd Apple OEM adapter that I've replaced, and it's both the cheapest and the most aesthetically pleasing alternative I've encountered. I'm not surprised to find entire websites devoted to lawsuits against Apple for the seventy-buck unrepairable gizmo that moreover likes to spark and short out circuits. One little tear in Apple's thin cord, or a bent pin in the plug, and say goodbye to the pricey little bugger.Even if your original plug is still plugging away, my advice would be to purchase the Macally immediately and save Apple's cute little folding prong for the rare occasions when you're traveling and wish to conserve space. Otherwise, don't be too surprised and upset when you discover your computer time is limited to whatever charge you have remaining in your battery.

so much more inexpensive than the apple adapter. takes a little longer to get to 100% but not significantly longer. easier to plug in anywhere vs. the apple adapter. significant differences in design and there is nothing on the adapter to indicate if its charging or if charging is complete.otherwise great buy!

Got tired of replacing over priced adapters provided by Apple. They are truly the Achilles heal of the Apple portables. This baby does the job and doesn't feel like it will break if I use it a little roughly. Maybe not as COOL looking and no amber/green glowing light but I'll take durability/reliability AND about half the price anyday!

Get this instead of Apple's power adapter. It costs less than half as much and looks very durable. The cable is long (10 feet) and come with a small velco strip to keep the cable tidy.I don't think they mention anywhere on the web but it is rated at 24W. This is good for some older powerbooks. The newer ones require 45W I think, but from what I have read this might be okay for those laptops as well. I'm just happy I got this after three failed apple adapters.

At half the price of the original Apple adapter, this is a good value. That said, I do miss the lcd ring around the plug of the Apple adapter, the one that glows green or orange depending on if the laptop is fully charged or is currently charging. It's useful to discern at a glance if I can take my laptop and go without wondering if it's fully charged. Also, the glowing ring would indicate that it IS charging -- sometimes the other end of the electrical plug will come loose, and I wouldn't be aware that the computer isn't charging if it wasn't for the light. However, being on a limited budget, the lcd ring is a sacrifice I'd make to save nearly $40.

This adapter has worked just fine with an older TiBook, and a newer 12" iBook. Certainly a good deal for the money. Things that you miss from the Apple chargers: the light-up tip that gives charging status, the cord winder, and the option to plug the brick directly into the wall, instead of using the AC cord.For my purposes, this adapter almost never travels, so it works fine. If I needed to pack it up frequently, I'd complain more loudly about the lack of cord storage.

I love Macs and have had them for years, but I get really irritated having to replace the low-grade peripherals all the time, especially power supplies. The Macally version is great. Smaller, lighter and longer than the Apple version, and half the cost. Works just fine. I've used macally stuff before and it's always very solid and well thought out, definitely fills a void.

Plug seems to be a little sturdier than my previous Apple-provided failure. That one lasted me 2 years, which isn't too bad. This is a good backup, but it takes more than twice as long to charge. I imagine this is because they set the current lower to prevent from frying the battery. Apple probably has a very exact amount of power to go through to the battery for optimum charging and safety to the battery that the 3rd party manufacturers haven't figured out. That said, it's a good thing that they were conservative. I've heard of other 3rd party power supplies destroying the battery over time. All in all, this is a great backup and it was the only thing available to me since Apple has their flawed adapter on backorder due to the huge demand for it. Unfortunately, I will probably wind up buying another Apple power supply and keeping this Macally as a backup. I wish Apple would pay a little more attention to their customers and fix an $80 item on a $2500 laptop, otherwise I might just be tempted to wander back into Windowsland.

I'm quite happy with this power adapter. It works well for my iBook G4. Overall, the cord is substantially longer than the original adapter. I do miss the little amber/green light ring, but it was certainly not necessary. Also, no cute little plastic plug cover (to lose). Overall, it is a utilitarian, even clunky design, not sleek and innovative like the original. The plug fits just as tightly into the socket as the apple adapter's does. The cord has a nice velcro wrap to keep it bundled when you're mobile. My only quibble is the ridiculous amount of plastic packaging used for this product.

I bought my first Macally a year and half ago, and it worked great for about 7-8 months. After reading all the then recent bad reviews, I decided to risk it and order another one...it's not worth it. My second Macally acts exactly as all the other defected ones: alternates between "charging" and "low battery" and doesn't fully charge unless the laptop is shut down.And here I am again, looking for another charger - looks like for the most part the reviews are still bad. Not sure why the first one was great but I would never buy this product again.This was my Jan. 2007 review (4/5 stars):The Macally adpater is probably one of the best buys I've made next to my 12 inch powerbook.If you're looking to save more than 50% of what an Apple charger would cost, have more than twice as much powercord length, and have a klutz-proof product, then purchase the Macally adapter!It may not have the "charging" light indication as Apple's charger but how useful is a short, sparking, and inconsistent charger to a laptop?

understand that this was bought for my 16 year old son. he was thrilled when it arrived, it got his computer back to working right away. of course then he did something that broke the computer so he only used it for about a week. that said, when i took the cable and tried to work on his computer, i discovered that in the short time we'd had the adapter he'd mangled the plug where it goes into the computer. not such that it didn't go back in with some effort, but that's not a good sign in my book for such a short amount of use. so my word of caution, be really careful with it, else you could have trouble down the line. too bad the cowl isn't nice & stiff like an RCA plug, that would solve the problem...

Well, I bought this because my charger plugs weakened and would not stay in full contact with a wall outlet or even on a power strip. Maybe the prongs would have an easier time laying limp on a flat floor outlet, but seeing as none of those are convenient, I gave up on the apple charger and now only use it away from my desk when I run out of power. (Almost Never)This charger works great and it sits discretely behind my computer, the only problem I have is when I run a shredder (an ancient reciept shredder) it seems to do something funny with the charger and the speakers that I have on the same power strip. Perhaps a new shredder is in order....

I bought this about a year ago when my Apple brand adapter stopped working. It serves its purpose, although it isn't as sleek as the Apple brand. I do miss the orange/green indicator ring, missing from this off-brand model--you must use features within OS X to check whether your you are charged, charging, or unplugged.The other problem is the absense of a ground plug, which sometimes causes issues of static buildup. (For the electrics-layman, the ground plug is what makes it so that you can't plug something into a two-prong outlet; it's a safety feature).With careful use, this product lasted me roughly one year. A few weeks ago, the plug that goes from the laptop to the adapter stopped working unless I fiddled with it, and now it doesn't work at all.Three stars for overall functionality-- one star deduction for lack of ground plug and LED ring, and one star deduction for the product not lasting the working life of the laptop.

This charger is horrible. Worked for long enough for me not to be able to get my money back from Amazon. Makes the screen blink while charging and flashes back and forth from charging to not charging. Customer service at this company is horrible. After waiting two weeks for a response they wanted me to send it back before I get a new one. Who knows how long that will take. I am probably going to have to trash this waste of money for the more expensive Apple one. I guess you get what you pay for.

I bought this power supply as a replacement for the one that came with my Powerbook G4. At less than half the cost of Apple's, this supply is equally functional and considerably more durable.

An AC/DC power converter is a very basic item, so I had little doubt that this sub for the expensive Apple original would be effective, though not stylish. Unfortunately, we have had problems. The Powerbook started delivering electrical shocks and inconsistent charging with this adapter, and they got worse when we moved to a country on 240V. I know that the shock problem comes from the Macally adapter because I have another PB and an original Apple power supply, so can do all combinatorial tests. I like Macally and have several of their other products. I probably just got a bum unit but unfortunately cannot deliver a positive review based on previous experience with the company.

The adapter worked fine for my power book g4 for a few months and then it broke. Nothing physically happened to the adapter for it to break, but suddenly it just wouldn't charge any more. What's interesting is that the blue light on the brick goes on when plugged in to a power source, but if I plug the cable that attaches the computer to the brick in, the light goes out and it doesn't charge.

After the wiring on my Apple charger split and threw sparks and smoke at me I decided to try this adapter. My order arrived promptly with no problems. The adapter itself is a lot nicer looking in person than in the photo. The photo makes it appear a dull grayish color (on my monitor anyway) but in person it is a brilliant white. The cords are sturdy and have snug connections. I keep my computer plugged in all day and night and the adapter is barely warm to the touch. I'm very happy with this purchase.

There have been a few negative reviews on this product lately. After looking into this, I found out what the problem was. The inventory that Amazon has is the original Macally product. However, some of the third party sellers are selling a product that is nothing like the Macally one. I have been using the Macally one for close to 3 years and have had no problems with it. But when I ordered one from one of the other sellers, I received a product that looked nothing like the original Macally one. I hope this clears up some of the concerns and confusions out there.

We ordered the Macally PS-AC4 power adapter and received an entirely different product from a differnt comany. As noted by other Amazon shoppers we received th Inspire M8482. This adapter is differnet in the following ways..instead of the 10'cord with a velcro wrapper, it has a short cord that leavesthe transformer hanging from the input of your computer. This will ultimately break the DC connection from the board..this is not repairable. Their is no led power light as advertised leaving you wondering if it is on. It is clearly a cheap knck off and we are taken for idiots who might not recognize that. I am mad! I just went through a similar thing with Overstock.

I work at home most of the time and go into the office a couple days a week. Recently while leaving home, I packed up the 17" PowerBook, mouse, external HD, but left the Apple power adapter plugged into the UPS. Ooops! Battery was topped off so I made it thru the 5 hr day at the office okay by being conservative (in an all liberal office!), but don't like working that way. Decided to get a second power adapter so I'd not make that mistake again -- one to travel (Apple), one to stay plugged in at home (Macally). After doing some research and reading lots of reviews, decided on a Macally, and I'm glad I did. I agree with all the positives I've read -- great price (less than half of Apple), runs cooler than Apple, nice long cord if you need it...and powers my 17" PowerBook perfectly. My suggestion: for $30 it's a deal, so get one before your Apple fails. Use Macally for primary, and you'll still have an Apple for secondary use.

I was dismayed when the adaptor that came with my ibook gave out. I was even more dismayed when I checked the prices for replacements online.I chanced upon this while browsing amazon and it is such a great alternative buy. The cord is longer than the mac adaptor. The size is manageable. While it doesn't have the indicator light around the edge of the cord, the price is much much better than the ones made by mac.It seems so much sturdier and durable too.

As someone who uses her laptop for several hours each day, being without an AC adapter can be a painful experience, so when I need a new one, I like it to show up in a timely manner and to actually work when I plug it in. This adapter...not so much.When I plugged it in for the first time, it charged my laptop battery for about a second before clicking off. Then on again. Then off again. Every second or so, there was an annoying little clicking sound as it switched itself on and off, and the battery continued to drain itself very slowly. In sleep mode, it would charge, but only after almost a full day. Eventually, it started working properly. For a couple of days, anyway, before it defaulted to the previous condition. In a word: unreliable.Needless to say, I immediately contacted the seller for a replacement, but I got no response. Tried again a few days later, and they sent a replacement with no questions asked, which was nice of them, but it was still a long time to be without a reliable adapter. (Note: The first adapter was actually working pretty well by the time the second one arrived, so I haven't actually tested the replacement yet.)

Beware: NOT compatible with the aluminum Powerbook, even though it says so on the packaging. Will simply not work (flickering screen, charge on and off).As someone else mentioned before, this AC adapter is NOT compatible with all aluminum Powerbooks, despite what you might be led to believe on this seller's page. I'd call customer service before purchasing this item with the serial # of your laptop handy (click the top left apple, "about this mac", then "more info") and get specific confirmation that this can supply power to your computer.I'm still giving it 3 stars though, since the shipping was really fast, and customer service was very nice/knowledgeable, giving me a complete refund for my purchase (including S&H;, etc).

I wouldn't suggest this charger unless you are selling your laptop to someone and just need it to prove the computer works.

I bought this adapter almost two years ago and it still works-kind of. The insulation on the area of the cable where it enters the brick has become damaged, exposing the outer wire. I taped it up, but there is always a connection issue, where the AC indicator at the top of the screen will often flash to battery power and then back to AC. I keep the AC adaptor in the front compartment of my backpack, so it sees some but not major abuse. I'm sure this won't be an issue if you aren't traveling with it, but I just thought I would relate my experience.

The Apple Powerbook G4 laptop is well-known for its battery/adapter problems. My Powerbook G4 laptop was purchased in 2005. Within a year of purchasing, my original Apple adapter fritzed out and stopped working. I replaced it with a Macally adapter for G4 which worked just fine until a couple months ago, when it stopped providing power to my laptop. I searched again online for an adapter and ended up replacing it with exactly the same product -- the Macally power adapter for G4. To get 4+ years of use out of the inexpensive Macally product compared to spending a lot whole lot more $$ with Apple is well worth it to me. I expect this new adapter will last just as long. I also like the nice, long cord.

After using the charger for about 2 weeks I started noticing drops in the power feeding to the iBook. After about 2 months the charger stopped working altogether. On inspection I noticed that the metal part of the plug was separating from the plastic part and I suspect this is causing the disconnect. MacAlly has no warranty information on their web site and I called them several times only to be diverted to a messaging system and I never got a callback.I'd say avoid if you can.

I wasn't sure this was spec'd for my G3 IBook, but another review and some looking into the hertz/watts thing convinced me. I'm hoping it'll be a backup for my G4 Powerbook too. It works fine.

I read many positive reviews before buying this product, so my thanks to all of the previous posters. This adaptor is actually really great. I was a little upset before because I thought I was replacing my old G3 adapter with an even uglier one but was very happy to see that it isn't like the picture. It's the same shape but the chords everything is white, so it matches well with my ibook. It also has a pretty blue light that shines when the AC is connected, but it doesn't do much else. So if your worried about having an ugly adapter don't be because this is actually pretty nice. (at least much nicer than the G3 model adaper)

I too have the same problem most recent reviewers have had: when I plug the charger in, it cycles between charging and not charging every two seconds. The computer doesn't end up charging.In addition, the version I have doesn't look like the picture on the Amazon web site, and doesn't have the power LED.Clearly there is an epidemic of defective chargers. And we, the customer, have to go to the hassle of obtaining a return authorization and sending it back.I notified the seller. I am also going to notify Amazon to research this topic, and take the product off the site until they can resolve the issue. Other than this charger, my experience with Amazon has been exemplary.I strongly suggest that if you too have bought one of these chargers and have had trouble with it, please post here.

I bought one of these in July after my original one of three years went on the fritz. At first, it seemed to work fine on my 12-inch Powerbook G4. It had to turn my laptop over to see the green light and insure that it was charging. It's a bit inconvenient since the original one lit up at the connection so that I could immediately see it's charging state. The Macally Adapter charged my battery and spare with no problems.The real issue came when I wanted to use my computer at the same time as charging it. The screen flickered dim and full, every few seconds. The effect is just like the difference when the original charger was plugged in with the computer power-saving feature on. The screen goes from power-saving dim to full power, only this time, it keeps cycling. When I opened the Powersaver I could see that the charger was cycling between charging and not charging. Then I read on another web site that the Macally Charger doesn't work with Aluminum powerbooks, which mine is.If you just want to charge your powerbook when it is off, the charger seems to work okay (at least, after a month of use). But trying to use the computer with the power plugged in, like you might do giving a presentation, is most annoying.I wish I had check this one out a bit more. It's not easy finding a charger now that Apple no longer makes the 12-inch. I can't vouch for how this might work on other laptops but I sure don't recommend it for the 12-inch Powerbook G4.

After a few days of usage it started to charge for a second, then stop for a second, repeating on end. I've read some more reviews, and it seems this is a common problem. Though it seems other people are satisfied with this product, so my advice would be to stay away from a product with such an evidently high percentage of lemons unless you feel like rolling the dice.

The Macally PS-AC4 Power Adapter would not charge my PowerBook. I tested it with a multimeter, and found that it had an open lead.I contacted Amazon (even better, through their web site - no waiting on the phone or waiting for an email), and they shipped another.This second one had the same problem as the first.I contacted Amazon again for a refund.The product was junk, but the service was excellent!

When my OEM apple powercord finally broke for my old G3 labtop, I was scared it was going to cost a lot to purchase a new one. Thank goodness MacAlly now offers a powercord for Apple laptops. This cord works great and is much sturdier than the apple power cord. The cord is thicker than the original and the power box is no where near as heavy nor does it get as hot as Apple's. I can't believe I waited so long to get one. After having 3 cords fray on me ( I have more than one Apple lap top) I am so pleased to find an affordable replacement that's better than the original (albeit not as "cute.") But still this is a very good piece of equipment and a good price at $30. I eventually plan to replace my other computer's powercord, too, with one of these. I highly recommend this item. And with Amazon Prime I got it in a couple of days at no extra charge!

This is a far better ac adapter than Apple's original, and for less money.The only downside is you don't get visual confirmation that you are charging. I went through two Apple chargers in 3 years. Although they replaced the first under Apple Care, I was told later that it isn't really covered by the Apple Care warranty and they should not have replaced it. In any case I was not about to buy a third at Apple's price when they regularly wear out. I'm told the new magnetic a/c adapters also have problems, so I hope these folks will make a unit for the newer machines too, but they may run into patent issues?

I got the Macally power cord after the Apple one that came with my iBook finally broke down 2 years after purchase. I will agree that this model isn't as aesthetically pleasing as the Apple version, and I do miss having the orange and green indicator light to let me know that my computer is charging, but the difference between $30 and $80 is enough that I'm willing to give up the eye candy for the price. The Macally power adapter charges my computer just as well as the Apple version, it just doesn't look pretty while it does it. Also, it's a bit bulkier and takes up more space in my laptop bag. Still, the $50 I saved makes it worth the added weight. Unless you have serious reasons for buying the Apple power adapter (eg, vanity), I would go ahead and get the Macally version. Your pocketbook will thank you, and you can spend the extra money on other Apple extras.

I had the original Apple charger that came with my Powerbook G4. It lasted me about a year and a half. I opted for this Macally charger, for two reasons, 1. the price 2. the great reviews on Amazon. I have had the charger for less the 6 months and it is already non-functional. Yes it is cheaper than the Apple charger, but it really comes out to the same price, considering that an apple charger costs about $90 and lasts 1 1/2 years and the Macally costs $30 and lasts six months.

As a replacement for the stylish Mac power brick the MACALLY adapter provides the best choice in a compact, utilitarian ac adapter. I doubt one could find a better value. For half the price of OEM you only give up the charge state led in the connector and the wire wrap "wings".

I have been using the Powebook iBook AC Adapter for several weeks now with my Ti-Book, DVI. The product works great, and is a good (economical and functional), replacement to the Apple OEM Power Adapter. Only complaint is the Apple OEM provides an effecient method for knowing if the battery is charged with the variation of colored LEDs.

I bought this plug as a substitute to replace the Apple one that blew out. Unfortunately, this plug seems to have problems. I noticed that it heats up really badly when plugged into some plug outlets and causes my laptop to heat up as well. Once, I also heard some noise coming from my iBook G4 that wasn't there before. This noise went away when I unplugged the power cord. What I'm most upset about though is that it seems to have shortened the battery life of my computer to about 50% now! I think I should have bought the Apple plug instead.

As my original iBook AC Adapter broke its little connector I decided I needed two more to replace it. One for two locations and also as back up if one were to break. So I bought one Macally and a BTI. Well after a while of usual use the BTI unit broke in the same way as the original! So I now have a second macally unit and both are still going strong.

Unfortunately I shall not be able to review the Macally Power Adapter. I did not pay due attention to the fact that the AC adaptor works with G3 iBook and G4 PowerBook only.I plugged it in with a G4 iBook , it made some complaining noises and it died. Maybe it would be proper to really WARN that it will NOT work with a G4 iBook in CAPITAL LETTERS.$40.- down the drain!

My original Apple power adapter started sparking, Apple said it was my fault (though numerous others had similar problems), so I replaced with these. They are a bit clunkier, so I leave one at work and one at home, as I was able to buy a few of these at the price of one Apple unit.

I just bought my second one. We have 3 Macs at our house and the cords do not hold up. I dreaded replacing them but I like my computer. I tried this the last time my cord went and it worked great, so when the most recent power cord fell apart I did not hesitate. It does the same job at a third of the price!

I bought this power adapter literally seconds after my original Apple one died. When it came in I was very pleased. Sure its not quite as compact as the Apple one, the cords aren't quite as nice, and you don't get the cool glowing thingy that connects to your laptop, but all thats fine. The Macally power adapter feels decently heavy, not cheap, and it works perfectly. The cord length is just about the same as the Apple adapter so no worries there.Losing a glowing end and a tiny bit of size in order to cut the price in half compared to a new Apple adapter is very much worth it.

I've never had any problems with our Apple adapters other than the fact that our puppy chewed the ends off two of them. I ordered this one based on its price and reviews and have found it to be workable but inelegant. With no easy way to wrap it's cords, it tangles easily, and I end up carrying it in a clump from place to place. The bit of velcro that's included is only helpful if you take the time to roll the cables carefully--a far cry from Apple's pop-up hooks. If my wife's Apple adapter ever finds its way into the puppy's mouth, I'm likely to spend the extra cash to get an Apple replacement.

As many mac users have been reporting, the power adapter that came with my G4 PowerBook originally was very sleek and visually pleasing but had flimsy functionality. I didn't have any problems with the Mac cord for three years and then it literally fell apart in less than two weeks. I bought this Macally power adapter because it had many good reviews from other Mac owners experiencing the same problem, and the Macally adapter was less than half the price of an Apple replacement cord.It arrived quickly and safely, the product was actually better looking in person than in the product image, and it has since fulfilled my needs beautifully. I've actually been rather rough on this one but it shows no signs of wear or tear. This is a GREAT alternative to searching for and purchasing an overpriced replacement cord from Apple. The two cords actually look the same over all, and have only minor differences in appearance. The durability and reasonable price of the Macally cord has me sold.

I wouldn't get this for a newer machine, but decent for an old beater laptop. Main complaint is that the powercord doesn't detach from the adapter (though a previous reviewer said it came as three parts) as I like to leave the powercord plugged. Though Apple no longer sells the yoyo, the cordwrap feature on the OEM was a nice feature. Unlike the picture my Macally has white cords, not gray, which is more aesthetically pleasing.

After 4.5 months, the adapter died. I contacted Macally about the one year warranty and learned :1. the only way they will issue a refund is if the adapter causes a fire!2. I needed to send the adapter to the manufacturer in California for them to evaluate--I would be without a power cord for a week. They said the replacement adapter might be refurbished.Ultimately, I went to the Apple store and purchased a Mac power cord.

After going through 2 OEM Apple adaptors, and deciding that I can't justify my budget for power adaptors going through the roof, I decided to try this adaptor.After a month of use, I have to say I am well pleased. This is a great price for a simple product. (Really, how complicated can a power adaptor be?)PRO: It is solid white (although the picture makes it seem not to be) just most like apple products and it does the simple task of powering my PowerBook.CON: It does not have the LED lighting at the base like the OEM does, but this is only a small loss.This is a great value minded replacement. I really can't say you would have any different experience with a Apple adaptor for over twice as much...

its is unclear rather this really works with G4 Powerbook. the connector that plugs in to the powerbook fits , but the connection itself is unstable and easily disrupted by just a little wiggle or touch of the cable or connector. If you are looking for a replacement cable go with Apple branded. that one works .

This is one of the most poorly designed and implemented chargers around. I own a 15" Powerbook G4 (which this is listed as being compatible with).The problem is that this isn't actually a 65watt power cord... so don't expect to use your computer while it's charging... and don't expect to be able to touch the "brick" as it's plugged in, you'll burn yourself.I've returned this item and got a charger from another company for just a few dollars more that works a TON better.

Beware: some customers reviewed this product as compatible with other apple computers, besides those listed as compatible. I have an ibook G4 from 2005 and this charger did not work on my computer. It fit in the slot and my computer registered a charger, but it didn't ever begin charging. It is true that the real apple charger is $80 and is known to catch on fire, melt, etc, so I would recommend buying an alternate charger - just be sure it is compatible.

Spoke praises too soon after owning the product for just a couple of days. Turned out, after about five days of use, the adaptor would not charge my battery -- I'd plug it in, but the battery icon and the a/c power icon (lightning bolt) kept flickering back and forth as the battery drained down. I guess in this case, "adaptor" is an acronym for A Disappointing Amazon Purchase To Obviously Return. I packed up the product, returned it, and was promptly sent a new one, which had the same exact problem after only one hour of use -- if you read the other one-star reviews here, you'll see that this is a very common problem with this product! I'm nutty enough to give it one more try, if they'll send me yet another adaptor -- will post again with review, and if the third one doesn't work, either, I believe the seller has a moral obligation to remove this product from Amazon. Oh, and for the record, I tried my old original Apple adaptor and, despite it's loose, wobbly connection, it charged my computer just fine! (So the problem is definitely their product, not my computer.)

First, know that this review applies to a unit I bought USED. My complaint may not apply at all to a new, fully warranted unit. IF you're about to buy a used unit, consider my experience.In the last few weeks the connecting cable (from the converter to the iBook) began failing. I realized this because occasionally I found that leaving my iBook plugged in would not fully charge it, sometimes over several hours. Finally, a couple of weeks ago, I noticed that with the MacAlly plugged in -- and its blue light on, indicating that current reaches the unit -- my charge indicator in my iBook menu bar fluctuated: charging AC, using battery, charging AC, using battery.Now aware of the problem, at some points in following days I would even watch the percentage of battery power DROP as I used the iBook, plugged in -- while the MacAlly was showing its pretty blue light.I've turned the connector firmly to the 90-degree angle on each side, and still it's unpredictable and therefore unreliable.So that pretty blue light don't mean nothin', folks, other than the fact that current reaches the converter. That's NO guarantee that your Apple gets juice.Remember, I bought this one used. Since I don't know how old it was when I got it, I can't assert anything about the unit's longevity. This unit worked fine for a few months as promised, so for the record, I do attribute the failure of the unit to normal wear and tear; I have no complaints against the seller.I contacted MacAlly. They said to return the part, with the original receipt. Not expecting any such problems as these, I didn't keep my seller's receipt. Anyhow, I don't know that MacAlly would honor it for a used item, and I wouldn't fault them for that. (Bravo to them if they would; I'd try it if I still had the receipt.)All things considered, I recommend that if you buy this unit, pay the relatively few bucks extra for a NEW one, with the full warranty -- just in case.

Like some other reviewers, the product I received did not look exactly like the one pictured. That's irritating. But, it functions perfectly, which is more than I can say for the expensive Mac chargers.Mac stores will tell you it's a "myth" that their chargers break.

I like having multiple power adapters for my laptop--ideally, one at home, one at work, and one in my travel bag. Apple's original power adapters have a tendency to fray and of course that happened to one of my adapters. Not wanting to risk a fire or shell out the $79 to get an Apple-branded one, I found this MacAlly adapter for a fraction of the cost.Pros: Cost, length is definitely acceptable.Cons: No LED charging light at the plug (not really a big deal since you can see charging status in the menu bar), annoying bright blue LED power lamp on the brick. The biggest problem I've encountered has been that this adapter cannot seem to both charge and power my 12" PowerBook when the screen brightness is all the way up. It alternates between charging and not about every five seconds. I returned my first power adapter to Amazon thinking it was defective, but the second one also does the same thing.Now, my 12" PB shipped with a 45W power adapter. The MacAlly one shows up as a 50W adapter under the system profiler. So, there shouldn't be a problem.But, for the fraction of the cost, I keep the brightness turned a bit lower when I'm using that adapter and everything seems to work out alright.

Bought this as a replacement for my ibook charger. Its about $40 cheaper than the apple proprietary version and does the same exact thing -> power my laptop.

This product doesn't overheat as much as Apple's original power adapter. I'd give it 5 stars, except it doesn't have an indicator to tell the customer when the laptop is fully charged.

I've had no problems with this charger so far. I purchased it as a replacement to the Apple charger, which stopped working due to the cord being so bent that it shorted out.

Everything the other reviews say about this product is largely true: the cord is thicker and more durable than the Apple adapter, the brick doesn't get as unnervingly hot, you can deal with the fact that it's not powerful enough to be used as a power source... but one day it just mysteriously stops working. I bought this to replace my broken Apple adapter and was generally very pleased with it, but about a month later I went to plug it in one day and it just wouldn't work. My laptop showed no connectivity, the little charge light on the brick didn't go on, and after tinkering with the thing at length I couldn't get anything to change. If you want a cheap, temporary replacement charger, I guess this would be fine. But for anything long-term it might just be worth shelling out $80 for something that at least lasts a year or two.

I bought this to replace my 'falling apart' original charger. Worked like a charm for 3 months, then I found my computer dying on me. The charging signal would change frequently from charging to not etc.. I ordered a new battery, as i thought it was on its way out. I downloaded coconutbattery, and that explained all i needed it to. It showed the charger as connected, BUT not charging. I scrounged up my old charger, hooked it up, and sure enough, connected AND charging. It is without a doubt the macally charger. So i recommend it if you only plan on using it for 3 months or less. So not only am I out a charger, i ordered a battery for no reason.

Adapter worked flawlessly for six months, then became intermittent. Seems to be broken or shorted somewhere near the connector to the computer. Even the ridiculously flimsy cord from Apple lasted longer than six months, so I can't say I'm pleased. Macally says they'll sell the connector cable separately for $17.00 which is not much of a bargain.

I have a powerbook g4. after my apple chargers broke twice within 2 years (once the tip broke off inside my computer and would have cost $1200 to repair-but only cost $200 due to applecare; the other time the charger randomly started shooting bright orange sparks inside the point that connects to the laptop), i decided to try this one. in january, i bought one of the original chargers as described in this listing from microcenter, with the blue LED light. during the first half hour, i got the endless charging/not charging/charging cycle, but eventually that subsided and it worked fine for about 2 weeks. I ended up buying a different charger from ebay and returned the macally charger, because i wasn't confident in the durability of this product.now its may, and the charger i bought off ebay completely stopped working, so i returned to microcenter. they have the NEW macally chargers that don't have the blue light. I bought one to hold me over until i can find a better alternative, and after 24 hours being plugged into my computer, it NEVER stopped the charging/not charging/charging cycle. it powers my computer just enough to keep it from completely running out of juice. about an hour ago, i went to microcenter AGAIN to exchange it for an identical one, and this seems to be doing the same thing. that's 3 products, from at least 2 seperate batches, that all have the same defect. i have one more hour to get to microcenter and I'm going to exchange this piece of crap for another apple charger. i expect the $80 apple charger to last me about a year.thank god the mac books have magnetic chargers. i'm sick of this crap.

We have 3 PowerBooks in the house, and 2 of them are using these cords now when their OEM powercords fizzled out - as the apple cords are known to do. While they don't light up, they do their intended job, and they do so without overheating QUITE as bad as the original cord. It still gets warm, so give it some space, but overall, a very nice product.

I have had to replace my powerbook power cord twice already. Both times before I broke the bank by purchasing the cord from apple. Big mistake. Although steep in price those things are C-H-E-A-P! This last time i decided to go with the Macally. What a great deal! Much more durable than then apple version. It is also more compact. The only thing missing is the indicator light to let you know if the battery is charging. Not a big deal for such a great price!

I was hoping for a cheaper replacement, but what I got was a charger that was not much more reliable than my previous Apple charger.The problem with this connector is that it doesn't always seem to make a good connection with the computer. When this happens, it sends the computer into a powered-charging-battery loop. I have to fiddle with the connector to get it in just the right spot to keep a good connection. While this is only an annoyance to me, I wonder what it's doing to the internals of my computer.

This power adapter was just the thing I needed after the Apple adapter fizzled out--the cord frayed and the connection was loose. I couldn't justify spending $50 to replace it with another Apple one that would do the same thing. The Macally adapter is perfect; the connection is solid and tight, and it is well made. It is even white to match the product. A nice blue LED lets you know it's plugged in. One thing it is missing is the green/orange indicator LED to let you know when the charge is complete. But that's not a necessity anyway. Overall I have been extrememly pleased and the price is right.

This is a great product, with one flaw: there is no visual indicator as to whether or not the PowerBook is charged or charging. On the stock adaptor, there is a lighted ring near the laptop that signals orange for charging, green for charged. There is only one LED on this adaptor, and it's always blue, so there's no way to know if your laptop is completely charged or not.One advantage for this adaptor is that it uses a regular plug compared to the original Apple model that has a heavy power block which is prone to falling out.Also, this adaptor comes with plenty of cable...maybe too much (!) and, while it's not as attractive as the Apple adaptor, it's not ugly, either.

The Macally PS-AC4 is a great replacement item for the OEM power unit. A bit larger than the original, it provides an easy velcro strap that easily contains the wires or releases them to do their duty. Easy to use with a better strain relief than that of the OEM. The loss of the tell-tale light at the base of the adapter plus is missed, but hte positives out weight this little omission.

Macally PS-AC4 AC Power Adapter for Apple G4
I've gone through two adapters made by Macintosh for my laptop. This one is far superior to the Macintosh made product. It doesn't overheat. The connection stays tight.The only thing to remember is to turn off the power stip or unplug after use, because the adapter continues to draw energy even when not in use. But turning off the power strip is a good habit to get into anyway - helps save the environment - so that isn't a complaint.

Although this is a wonderful working power adapter, I don't believe it is the Macally Adapter that was advertised. I am however happy with it and would shop with this vendor again.Thank you.

After damaging my 2nd Apple power adapter beyond repair (stepped on #1, dropped laptop directly on to #2), decided to save a bundle with the Macally. The product shipped on time (2 days) and in original Macally packaging. Product is solidly constructed, quality design and parts. Bright blue power lamp can be annoying because in order to rest the unit to allow maximum air cooling the lamp faces the user. So far have also noted heating of unit but not enough to refrain from use. (Would not recommend placing unit directly on carpeted floor in confined space unattended.)I use my G4 Titanium Powerbook as a desktop replacement with ViewSonice 22" monitor and therefore power adapter is always plugged in. Rests on wooden desktop with no discernible heat damage to desk. It appears to be a more professionally designed product than the OEM Apple adapter, especially the connector that plugs into the laptop itself. Would have liked a protective cover for that plug; however, the presence of one did not stop me from destroying the previous two connectors beyond use. Also there is no lamp at the plug (as in the OEM) to indicate that a solid connection has been made; therefore, you must open a powered-up laptop to ensure that it is charging properly.

I got this Macally adapter when my original iBook adapter cord broke (the wires at the power point separated) and it works awesomely! (despite the lack of a LED light to indicated whether it's fully charged or not) All those looking for a replacement should definitely get this instead of another liable-to-break Mac adapter. =)

I have a PowerBook G4, this adapter works exactly as promised, provides adequate power, and is generally amazing. It doesn't have a charging light, so I have to watch the battery meter in the menubar, and when I have headphones in or I use the analog audio out with this adapter attached there is a ground loop in the left channel. My other adapter, a 45w, does not have this same issue, and it does not affect the digital audio.

My now ancient iBook's adapter finally become too unsafe to use; the Mac Ally adapter works and cost a lot less than an Apple OEM one.

Macally PS-AC4 AC Power Adapter for Apple G4
I must say that this adapter is ten times better than the one that came with my ibook. The cord is heavier, it comes in three parts which will make it easy to replace a section, it plugs into the socket without that huge power pack blocking the other outlet, and the charge to my battery was quick! I wish that this one came with my computer when I purchased it.

This is a solid replacement for Apple's charger. It is light weight and does the job it was intended to do. Blue "on" light simply tells you it's plugged in, but there's no indicator to tell you when the computer is fully charged. Lacks the portability elegance of the Apple charger, but costs a lot less.

My husband and I both have Mac laptops and the dog chewed his charger to pieces (yay!) and after five years of use, my charger literally started smokig while it was plugged in (yay!)I went to the Mac company store to buy new chargers, but at a whopping 79.99 I only bought one. I found the MacAlly charger on Amazon.com and decided to give it a try. When we got it and tried it out I immediately returned the Mac brand charger for a refund. I love the MacAlly charger! Its actually long enough to be practical. It doesn't fall out of the wall socket from its own weight (imagine that.) And it never gets hot enough to fry eggs.BUY IT! It's less than half the cost of the brand name, it's a more practical design, and it's still small enough to fit into my little laptop bag. Sure, its not as novel or cute, and it doesn't have the little Apple insignia on it, but I'm not paying eighty bucks for one charger when I could buy the two that I needed for about the same.

Macally PS-AC4 AC Power Adapter for Apple G4
Works very well and at a very reasonable price. It is built a lot stouter than the Apple power supply it repaces and at less than half the cost. You might miss the light on the plug but it work fine witout it. I doubt that the light is worth an extra $50.00.

So far so good. I have used power adapter since my Apple Adapter got a short in the cord. I have owned various Apple Laptops and almost all of the power adapters have needed replacing. I like to buy Apple branded replacements but they cost twice as much as this one. I have been using it for several weeks without any problems.

Though the output of this power supply is lower than the Apple supply, it seems to work fine--and it is very reasonably priced. Too bad that Amazon stopped carrying the supply.

This adapter doesn't have the "cool" factor that the original AC adapter had. I didn't really use just the plug attached to brick option on the original, which is the only thing this adapter lacks. Very good product.

Macally PS-AC4 AC Power Adapter for Apple G4
The MACALLY POWERBOOK AC ADAPTER works perfectly and the best thing is that I have it and didn't have to wait 4 to 6 weeks like Apple was telling me. We will see how long it lasts but being able to buy two of them for the price of one Apple one is another advantage. Apple you need to be ashamed for even putting your supporters in the position of having to go to an aftermarket supplier. Makes me think of what other aftermarket things I need to be looking into.

Macally PS-AC4 AC Power Adapter for Apple G4
The price is nice, but charging time is twice as long.I'm using this on a 17" G4 Powerbook.For example:-when your battery runs out and the computer shuts down, with the stock battery it's about a 3 second wait (once you connect the plug) and you can turn your computer on.-with this charger, it takes about a minute before the computer gets enough of a charge to get things going again.-then it takes twice as long to get to full charge.It's still a good buy compared to the price of an Apple brand charger, but there is a pay off...

Considering it costs less than half the price of the original Apple adapter, it's a wonderful piece of equipment. it's great it is white as the iBook, and the cable that goes to the laptop is stronger than the original one. Just two thing to have in mind: it isn't able to charge a completely drained battery and run heavy apps at the same time; the other thing is that I miss the green and ambar light in the original connector!

Much more durable than the Apple adapter (my Apple one broke in 2 months), and MUCH better priced. I think this is the best one around for the value. Only downside is that there is no indicator as to when it is charging (the Apple one has Green v. Amber color). All in all, a great buy.

Purchased this to replace the OEM power adapter (puppy chewed it up). Works fine, does the job. A little bulkier than the OEM, and I would have liked the same type of LED system to indicate charging/fully-charged status. Still, for the price, it's just fine.

Much better value than the OEM charger that has a poorly designed strain relief.

B0001YXWVO
Macally PS-AC4 AC Power Adapter for Apple G4
This product is a much better, cheaper alternative to the official replacement ($80). Apple should consider a general recall and replacement program, lest one of their poorly-designed chargers be directly implicated in a major fire, lest many consumers begin to engage in a class action lawsuit regarding their terribly-made and poorly-conceived product.Buy this product, or take action to make Apple address the problem rather than NOT LISTENING to consumer's concerns.

I don't know how long I searched and searched for a replacement for myPowerbook G4 power adapter replacement. I looked at Computer City,Apple Stores, apple.com, and even Ebay. The old adapters aren't availablein either of the two stores and online the adapters can hit you up for 80bucks! Ugh!This adapter works great with the generation of apple laptops before theMagSafe adapters and it's much less prone to malfunction and designflaws that will enable it to rip, etc. Very elegant, too.

This thing works fantastic! My fiance accidentally broke off the prong inside her computer and after ordering the part for it off ebay and fixing it myself for 30 bucks, I ordered this new cable hoping 30 bucks for the power source would be well spent rather than the $90 from apple. Well it works fantastic! Course now we discovered her battery is dying. Guess it's time to order an OEM battery too!! ORDER THIS PRODUCT IT WORKS PERFECT!

This unit is well built and works really well. It was just used to startup from a drained battery(left my Mac on battery all nite..duh). Well, at 0% charged, I plugged this unit in and starting web browsing, in minutes the charge was at 2% and rising, as well as keeping up with the browsing demands. For the price, it cannot be beat. It also seems I keep forgetting to unplug the original charger when I pack to do travelling, so this new unit makes a great spare to keep packed in my laptop case.

The IBOOK AC ADAPTOR is so much sturdier than the MAC version. The long cord is a plus and does not coil up or twist like the MAC. The blue indicator light on the charger lets me know that the unit is on and functioning. The pricing is so much less than the MAC cord and in my opinion is a much better unit.

The construction is solid, and the device has no serious shortcomings aside from it's 50w power output which limits it's usefulness for 15" powerbook users.

I have had no problem with this so far. I've been using it for the past month and it has done exactly what is supposed to. The cord is much longer than Apple's charger and seems a lot more durable. People keep complaining about how it doesn't have the light charging indicator on it, but as long as you have the icon on your computer that signifies it's charging you are fine. And at this price, you can't beat it.

B0001YXWVO

I like this a lot - it does not bend at the junction the way the mac one does and the mac one almost encourages that break with the way the cord wraps up. This one has a super long cord (that I keep partially coiled). The only drawback is it doesn't have the green/red charge clue around the plug but you can always look at your screen to see what % charged you are.

B0001YXWVO
Macally PS-AC4 AC Power Adapter for Apple G4
It doesn't catch on fire! What else am I supposed to rate it on?Actually, there is one thing - the plug the connects to the computer doesn't glow green or yellow to signify battery charge status like Apple's does, which keeps this from getting the full 5 stars.

Macally PS-AC4 AC Power Adapter for Apple G4
We found this adapter to be a satisfactory alternative to the more expensive Apple replacement adapter. We read other reviews that suggested it may be more durable as well. It doesn't light up around the plug-in but it does have a light on the brick which shows it is charging.

This works perfectly on my powerbook, and is in my opinion better than the stock powerbook charger. I never have to wiggle this one into the right position to charge but doesnt plug in so tightly that if you pull on it it takes the whole computer with it.

This is a wonderful replacement adapter not made by Apple and is a great value for the dollar.

I bought this product to replace the original battery charger that came with my 12" Powerbook G4. Unfortunately, it seems that it only will add charge when I have the computer closed or off. If I have the computer open while the charger is plugged in, it not only doesn't add charge, it also makes the screen brightness oscillate.I wouldn't recommend this product for anyone who needs to charge their Powerbook while using their Powerbook. Wish I would've just spent the extra money on the Apple charger.

Short and simple: This charger did not charge my laptop's battery unless the computer was either off or at least in standby mode with the lid closed.It could keep the computer operating while plugged in, but it wouldn't charge my battery. I've seen other reviews with different results, but for me, this thing was pretty much useless.

I bought this charger near the end of May of this year and it stopped working about 2 weeks ago. It is not the same charger as in the picture with the gray cord. It looks just like most of the other generic chargers available on Amazon. It charges quite slowly (ibook g4 14"). I have a brand new APPLE brand battery, so I don't think it has anything to do with that or the computer. From now on I will stick with the cheaper generic chargers until my computer is totally dead.

My old adapter died a while ago, and since this appears to be the only charger still made that works for my iBook G4, I had no choice but to buy it. It has only been 8 months since I bought it, but the plastic coating on the wire near the block has broken open, leaving the wire bare. (And no, I don't wrap the cord tightly or anything-- when transporting it, I just fold it loosely. The plastic has to have been pretty fragile for it to break from so little stress.) It also makes an extremely high pitched noise when charging the laptop battery after it's been drained.It's still working for now, but I'm not comfortable having it plugged in when I'm not in the room, in case it decides to start a fire. Guess it's time to buy a new one... *sigh*

This product is advertised to work with the iBook G4, but it does NOT.This plug looks fine, but despite what the product description stats, it isn't compatible with the 3- to 5-year-old version of the 12-inch iBook G4, which I own and now must buy yet another plug for after this one didn't work.Consider yourself warned.

I have really enjoyed this product. It is lighter than the original adapter and seems to be more sturdy. It does not get as hot as my old one either. It doesn't have an indicator light to show that it is charging, but you can still see on your screen that the battery is charging as long as your computer is on. The velcro strap is very strong and doesn't loosen up, so the cord stays in a bundle. Very good product for a lot less money than the original charger. I'm really glad I bought it instead of the original model.

It is a bit different. I do miss the little LED light showing the chargers' status. SlimBatteryMonitor, an excellent donation-ware, does a better job of keeping you aware of your battery status anyway.Then again the cable that goes between the brick and into the iBook appears to be much stronger that the original Apple one. But hey for the low price and the seeming to be tougher its a pretty good deal.BTW Macally no longer officially makes these thing but the more important issues are safety and function.For the safety notion this unit carries the UL listing and several other similar verifications for a safe electronic device.I've had several Apple chargers die on me, always at the junction of the cable and that pretty little lighted thingie. So as they die I'll keep buying more of these.

The product link says the cable is detachable from the computer end to the brick, not true. It says it has an LED to show when it is charging, not true. It says it is for a PowerBook G4, not true (From the start I had to twist it to get it to tell my computer not charging. it doesn't have the power to charge). I returned the first one to get what was listed but Amazon sent the same thing out. I couldn't be bothered so I just stuck it in the corner.DO NOT GET IT, its too overpriced and doesn't do what it says. PRODUCT INFO IS FALSE!

After two go bad experiences with this product, all I can say is do not buy anything from Macally, at all. The first AC adapter for my G4 laptop went bad within 6 months and the second AC adapter was shot in less than five. When I say this product is junk, I'm not exaggerating. Basically, when you started to hear a high pitch whine, that was all she wrote. Within a week or so, the unit was dead. After the second one went dead I contacted Macally's customer service representative which was an exercise in futility. I was stonewalled at every turn. I finally just asked them to send me a new unit and they demanded proof of purchase. I then offered to send the old unit in but they wanted a receipt. All of this for a twenty dollar AC adapter. I'm sure this guy has a lot of practice giving his customers the shaft by virtue of the other bad reviews for this product. Do yourself a huge favor and do not buy anything from Macally.

Out of the difficult to open package, this adapter worked for a couple of days.I missed the light on the end of the standard Apple adapter (yellow for charging, green for charged).But the price was right, until, it started cycling on and off. The Mac screen would dim and brighten dim and brighten. Boy, was I glad to notice that the on screen battery light was cycling between a/c and battery. Unplugged the Macally, computer ran fine on just battery. Runs fine on the Apple charger I had left at home.The good news is the return to Amazon was extremely easy, presuming the lack of destroyed packaging doesn't void my refund.I've ordered a different brand (with light!). This one may have just been a bad example. I've had good luck with other Macally gear.

This product would intermittently charge my computer, charging about half of the time and not charging the other half.

Like every other Mac user, I think the replacement power cord with the bulky, cumbersome block is overpriced and less than durable, so I decided to outsource. What I got was never quite up to speed, but since my laptop mostly stays plugged in, the quick charge wasn't a must. Unfortunately, after a scant 8 months, with very little movement or unplugging (I've packed up my laptop for travel exactly twice in that time), the power cord has given out. There seems to be a short between the wires, with the hazardous side effect of causing random sparking at the connection between the computer plug-in and the wire. Needless to say, I'm not going back to this product!

I discovered the Macally Adapter courteous of a Mac Genius after I had left my orignial Powerbook adapter at work before leaving on a trip. I happened to be staying near a mall with an Apple store, so I went in to purchase an original Apple Powerbook adapter. Unfortunately, the Apple store was sold out of their adapters, but the Mac Genius allowed me to charge my laptop at the counter. While sitting at the counter, the friendly Mac Genius showed me the Macally Adapter when he had a break between helping customers and told me it worked great.I ordered one from Amazon and use it has my home charger while carrying the Apple charger when traveling. For the money, it is a great backup charger, and now I don't have to unhook and fish my Apple charger through holes on my desk to the surge protector for all my other computer peripherals.Rather than look like the Apple charger for Powerbooks/iBooks, the Macally charger is like most PC chargers. It's has two separate cords, the cord with the AC plugs is permanately attached to the rectangular white piece, while the cord that plugs into the Apple can be disconnected from both the laptop and the rectangular piece. It doesn't have the Apple orange/green filter and light at the tip of the plug, but I can simply look at the top right corner of my laptop to see if I'm charging versus using battery power.This adapter has Apple beat in the length of the cord itself more than doubling the length of the Apple adapter. Apple's cord is approx 6 feet, while the Macally measures over 12 feet.This is an excellent replacement or secondary adapter.For those frequent travelers:How many times have you checked into a hotel, and tried to find an electrical outlet near the desk or someplace you might actualy use. I travel 14 days each month and found a solution.One of the most useful tools on the road is a simple 9' White Extension Cord.....so many hotels have outlets behind beds and only one outlet available. Carrying an extension cord overcomes the pre-computer, pre-cell phone layout of many hotels. I carry a white extension cord not to match my Apple stuff, but so I don't leave it behind when checking out of the hotel. The white cord is more visible compared a black or brown one.Hope my extension cord tip is useful to some of you.

I loved this AC adapter. I actually thought that I'd found an adapter that would prevent my laptop from getting so darned hot and running the fan constantly... and I did!... for a while.Unfortunately, after 8 months, it has started making extremely noisy popping noises, and when I pull it from the laptop, it starts sparking! I'm worried to use it now believing it may very well be a fire hazard.As much as I like it, I'm afraid I'll start looking again for a suitable replacement.

Very pleased with this product that I bought as a replacement for a worn out Apple power cable. Apple has changed their plug system with the newest machines, but for anyone out there with a Pre-Intel Mac this is a great option at half the price of Apple's own product. Only gripe is that there is no power indicator light on the plug end, which is a feature on Apple's stock power cord.

This is GREAT. It works wonderfully, is sturdier than the Mac version (I think) and is totally compatible. I was skeptical, but it's just as good!My original was busted, the rubber on the chord was split and it had gotten to the point where it was sparking. You don't have to spend 80 dollars buying a new one!I'm not sure if it can convert power over-seas. I know the original does, so you may want to check if you're travelling.

After my dog chewed thru my Apple power adapter...grrrr...I was searching for a replacement and came across this one. It is much better made than the Apple adapter. The design is better..the cable is longer and the wire is thicker. This is great for reaching wall plugs that the Apple has difficulty reaching. It also costs less than half of the Apple version. One thing it doesn't have..is the glowing amber light around the input that let's you know it is charging ( Apple's turns green when the charge is complete) but that is no problem. The sturdiness is more important to me. I highly recommend this adapter!

After having trouble (as most people do) with my powerbook G4 cord, I gave this one a try. I have had it a couple months and it works great.At first I missed the orange and green lights that let you know if your computer is charged or being charged, but then I realized I had only looked at them so much just to see if my old cord was working. I LOVE my Macs, but Apple dropped the ball with their cords. Forget paying the big bucks for a new one from them. Buy this one, and forget about the crackling touchy Apple cord.

I purchased this adapter because it was almost $50.00 cheaper than the Mac version that came with the computer. It works great and I am happy with it. I do miss the little green/orange light ring that used to come on at the plug-in source, but for the savings, I can live without it. I do have two minor complaints. One is that the plug is not a three-prong, and it actually falls out of the socket in the wall sometimes. I find that if I squeeze the prongs together, it makes a tighter connection in the socket. Maybe it's just a problem with the socket, not the plug, although three prongs would probably solve the problem. The other complaint is that the very tiny blue light on the "box" part is actually very bright in a dark room. If you have the computer plugged in by your bed at night, you may wake up in the middle of the night to a dimly lit room, and it's a bit annoying. Overall, it's a good adapter, and I would recommend it to anyone who needs to save a few dollars.

This charger works great and charges as well as the apple product that costs twice as much. I miss the green and orange light at the end of the plug, but this one does have a blue light indicating it is plugged in.

My apple AC adaptor recently refused to work for my 2-year old 15" Aluminum 1.3G Powerbook, which was the only problem I had on my powerbook so far. After reading a lot of negative reviews on Apple adaptor, I tried this one. I was actually in doubt when I placed the order since this charger only has 50W and is supposed to be designed for ibook or Titanium only. Now I 'm very glad to see it works: powering up my notebook and charging the battery, cool and quiet.

At less than half the price of an Apple charger, Macally is a nice alternative. When my ibook charger's cord broke, I wanted to find something more durable. I miss the little feet to wrap the cord around, but the part that connects to the ibook/powerbook is thicker than Apple's and thus doesn't need quite as much care. Macally's charger is also white, which is a pleasant bonus, and comes with a blue light on the brick to let you know it's charging. Here's the basic breakdown.Macally:lightercheapermore durablesame 120/240 voltagesame length (when compared to Apple's w/ the extension plug)no feetno charging light around rim of plugno plastic cover for plug tip (though the Apple one fits on it perfectly)the connection to the brick is not as sturdy because Apple's is built in and Macally's is plugged in, though it's never come out unexpectedly because the brick is so light.doesn't get as hot as Apple's chargerthe wall plug is not groundedIf you need an extra or replacement charger and don't mind the difference in design then this is a great purchase.

The power cords for Powerbooks and IBooks, though aesthetically lovely, are prone to damage. This is a good replacement unit, although it lacks the amber/green LED charging indicator ring around the connector. Makes up for it in durability and value (less than half the cost of Apple's - yikes!). I'm using this charger with my 12" 867Mhz G4 with fine results.

This adapter only puts out 48 watts and is not for Aluminum Powerbooks. I am a technically minded person and I still got duped in to buying this because it doesn't say this anywhere on this page.

I now have two of these -- one for my Aluminum Powerbook, and one for my wife's Titanium Powerbook. They work great. The connection actually seems more solid than the one from the Apple version, and these are a heck of a lot cheaper. No, they don't have the nice status light or the elegant industrial design. But they power the laptops reliably, which is more than I can say for the Apple adapters we have!

This is my second PS-AC4. The first was exactly as pictured here and on the MacAlly website. It worked great and I would highly recommend it (I purchased it about 3 yrs. ago). However, the most recent one (ordered from Amazon) has been redesigned. There is no blue light, it's slightly smaller in size and DOESN'T work with the G4 iBook.I only use this power supply when I am on the road, so I only used it a couple times in the two weeks I've had it. Recently I was doing a Keynote presentation and noticed the iBook switching from battery to power supply every second and repeating, endlessly. I reset the Power Management Unit (PMU) on the iBook, but that didn't solve the problem. When I contacted MacAlly, they informed me that this model does not work with the G4 iBook. I was told "You need to return it back to your vendor for refund or different brand."Both MacAlly and Amazon do not reflect this new information on their website. MacAlly's site even says it's recommended for iBook users.I am still in the process of getting this issue resolved. My advice after messing around with 3rd party power supplies...buy a genuine Apple as a replacement. It's worth the money in the long run.

Initially I was going to give this power adapter 4 stars because it lacks that charge light that the Apple adapters have, but you just can't beat the price. It is an ideal and inexpensive replacement or companion adapter. You could by a few of these for the cost of just one from Apple. The only thing to take notice is that it may not charge a laptop as quickly as the standard Apple power adapter because of it's lower wattage.Pros:- Inexpensive- Inexpensive- Inexpensive- Durable- Velcro cord wrapCons:- No charge status light- Lower wattage then Apple adapter- Slightly larger then the standard Apple adapter

pros--CHEAP. Costs at least $50 less than the Apple product.-more durable than Apple. It feels like you could really smash around the AC adapter and it would still be OK. The apple one not as much. The connector to the laptop is an improvement, but is still not great.-Very light, easy to carry around.Cons--not the nice design features of apple - the light at the tip of the cord, the exchangeable plug, the overall appearance etc. (but who cares?) Also doesn't have a three-pronged plug-Does not charge computer as fast as apple, however not significant. Due to lower wattage.-Some heat issues- the adapter seemed to be as hot as or hotter than the Apple one, and it heats my computer up more than the apple one did. I haven't seen this in other reviews though, so it may be my computer or something.In general a good product. It seems fairly well made and will probably last you longer than your apple charger. If you're looking to replace yours, this will do the job fine, plus for $50 less you can't go wrong.

review/text: - while lacking the green/amber light on the end of the plug, it *does* have a bright blue LED on the brick itself. the LED doesn't change color according to what the powerbook is doing, it just indicates if the brick itself has power.- it produces 2 amps, rather than the 2.65 put out by apple's. this means that while it's ok for older ibooks and tibooks, for the new albooks it's slower to charge the battery if the machine is on, and for some machines like the newer 17", may not be able to charge the battery unless the laptop's asleep.(this can be annoying at times, but for less than half the cost of apple's adapter and cheaper than most other 3rd party adapters, I think it's a fair deal)- the wire on the powerbook side twist-locks into the brick, so you can't yank it out accidentally.- no, the plug isn't grounded... but then again neither is apple's flip-out plug.overall, I think this is a pretty good deal, and might pick up another.

Accidents will happen. $500 dollars later, with my 12" powerbook 1 GhZ (purchased October 2003)repaired and with the internal pin shorn from inside the power connector, I started to explore alternative adapters, given that the Apple unit is around $80.I bought this unit--which I needed quickly-- with one day shipping and my total was still signifigantly less than purchasing another adapter from Apple, some $51.Sure, it doesn't have all the bells and whistles of the Apple unit and it is a slight bit slower to charge the laptop, but the price makes it well worth it.If you are concerned about the plug fitting your computer, I've tested this unit out in my 12" PowerBook, a 14" Ibook, and even an older 15" TI Book--it fit them all and charged them, though I don't know how quickly it charged the 15" TiBook.The plug is also more reliable and sturdy. The cord is longer and less obtrusive than the mac power adapter--if I'd had this unit before, I don't think I would have even had the aforementioned accident! The Macally unit bundles nicely and fits most laptop bags well.Overall, I'm very pleased.

While the MacAlly powerbook ac adapter has it all over the original ac charger in terms of length (it's nice to get further away from the outlet to be sure), it's not altogether reliable as a charger. There are many times when I'll find, if I haven't been paying strict attention, that the cord has shifted slightly and, though it looks like it's still plugged in, it is no longer charging the computer. I've left it charging overnight to find in the morning that the battery is still not full. Makes me appreciate the charge indicator ring on the original cord that much more, too bad the Apple cords are A)given to dangerous wear & tear, and B)expensive to replace.

Hummer HBB-1000Y MusiXstation Boombox with CD/MP3 Player and AM/FM Tuner
I am fairly satisfied with the MusixStation. Blue Raja's review is a bit of a misnomer to the depth of this product. I hope I can shed a bit of light on the real aspects of the MusixStation as I did some research before I purchased.BACKGROUND: I work in the construction industry and was looking for a boombox with durability and a MP3/WMA compatable cd player. I have seen and heard about a half dozen different radios (DeWalt, Milwalkie, Scott, Bosch, and a few other knock offs) developed for contstruction sites and most of them are okay. After having heard them and read the reviews on them, none of them was what I was looking for. The Bosch cube was the only one which came close but the lack of a functional antenna and no reception put and end to it. It must be noted that the MusixStation was not designed for a construction jobsite. It is just designed well and durable.FUNCTIONALITY: The MusixStation controls are fairly easy to use if you read the instructions. The different features allow you to program the box to do quite a few different things. The remote is fantastic. I clip the little sucker to my tool belt. The range on the remote is decent. Allows me to make the changes I want without having to go to the unit itself. The cd player is fantastic. When playing an MP3 or WMA cd it has an 80 second skip buffer! Additionally, you can hook a computer, mp3 player, or a microphone up to it.SOUND: Fantastic! As with any boombox, if you put it in a corner, the bass sounds much better. With the sub-woofer and loudness function on, the MusixStation has great sound and power. Speaking of power...POWER: This thing eats batteries for lunch. I would not advise using the battery function unless you absolutely have to and for no longer than an hour or two. After that, it sounds like garbage. IMHO, the unit is under powered in the battery department. The power supply is effective. It can aslo double as a small boulder or lethal weapon. However, when the power supply is used with the MusixStation, it has no operational problems due to power consumption.DISPLAY: The LCD display is a little delicate but does the job. Fortunately, it lays down flat on the unit which protects it.OVERALL: I give it a 4 and a half. I paid about a hundred bucks for the MusixStation. Which stacks it up in the range of the other jobsite radios. With the noted exceptions above, I am happy with my purchase and would recommend the product.

Hummer HBB-1000Y MusiXstation Boombox with CD/MP3 Player and AM/FM Tuner
I sent this item back the day I received it and I'll tell you why.1. SIZE - I suppose I should have judged the size based on the CD compartment (frame of reference in the photo), or even gone through the trouble of reading the measurements or weight. At any rate, this boombox is certainly appropriately named. Though not a gas guzzler, it certainly must require a lot of juice since the power chord has one of those HUGE, yes, HUGE power BOXES within the cable. That alone is an extra anchor to carry or have around. The body and weight of the entire unit is enormous. If you want a deck party system or beach side boomer for crowds and don't care about the size of the unit, then this is not an issue, but I like to be able to take a "portable" device practically anywhere... I mean this thing takes up the entire kitchen counter!2. CONTROL - If you wish to choose the CD function, or AUX (input) function, or Tuner, etc... you can't just PUSH a certain button or throw a switch. Rather, you have to jog (turn) a cheap-feeling plastic dial, watch on the LED what it says ("AUX", "CD", etc.), THEN push the button down to engage the mode. To me that is an obstacle, I want to select things quickly. All the dials have a cheap feel about them (very light plastic and fast torque with little resistance).3. "COMPARTMENT" MISLEADING - I'll admit that I do not have an iPod, so perhaps an iPod MINI may fit better (I have a minidisc player), but I was under the impression that a door can CLOSE and completely conceal or protect a portable device. Instead, the LED monitor flips up to reveal a small area for the portable mp3 device to sit in. This works well if you wish to still see your unit, and let it kind of "stand" up in the compartment... but then, the LED screen is partly in the way of seeing it. The input jack is on the BOTTOM of the compartment (not side) so if you plug a mini cable in, that now blocks part of the compartment for your device to fit in.I cannot comment on the remote since I didn't even try it. Now perhaps the most important thing I did NOT comment on is the SOUND. That is because I thought it did sound excellent and powerful. The "LOUD" feature adds a decent punch, and the built in subwoofer is decent for a portable device, but certainly cannot be compared to any "real" subwoofer or computer bass cube. However, again, due to the size of the whole thing, I figured some shelf-systems were just as "portable". I bought this device mainly due to the mp3 player input & compartment, and have decided to stick with some computer speakers that have decent bass in them due to the compact size, and I'm not throwing parties... I'm just doing the dishes or chillin on the couch.If I were to rate this item strictly for sound I would give it a 5, but the overall package of this "portable" device brings my rating down to a 3.

First of all ,WOW !....For this price you can't beat it ! Believe me I've had a lot of Boomboxes and I do a lot of research online when I'm looking for a product.I'm a musician and drive for a living. So I know when I hear a distorted bass or a weak kick drum sound which is the most difficult to produce in a small unit. And, I know how hard it is to keep that good sound when in a vehicle or when out side. I've had my share of "Boomboxes" . From $59 to $149 all bought at Wal-Mart, Bestbuys, etc. Not one had a sub woofer.This box has amazing sound. Sound quality that you can adjust like; separate bass and treble...Enhanced by a real 8 watt, 4 inch woofer you can select On or Off. A Loudness button you select On or Off. Anti-skip CD play back when in vehicles, etc, works great. LCD Display...very nice. Remote...love it. Buttons...nice touch and look.Basically give it the correct input of power and you'll get all of the two 5 watt and one 8 watt sub woofer output of sound. I think it's well made. Looks great. Size...a bit on the big side but, I've had all sizes. Users manual a little vague.I use a power inverter off of a 12v DC power point in my vehicle and house current at home. The 8 size D batteries are only good for short periods at low volumes.This box is power hungry. It's only as good as the power you feed it.I will probably buy one more for home use only. I paid just under a hundred. I would recommend this product.***** UPDATE 5/7/06 *******I just purchased a 2nd one for around the pool, back yard, etc. and like I said before,...for the price you cannot beat it! This time I took amazon up on their offer with there visa card promo and free shipping and payed $74.99 total!!! You tell me where you can get this kind of sound for that kind of price. don't forget it works best off of house current and it's just a bit weak on tuning in local radio stations but it could be just my location.All in all,... this thing has great sound. Beats anything you can find at your local big box piggly wiggly store,...hands down!!!

Hummer HBB-1000Y MusiXstation Boombox with CD/MP3 Player and AM/FM Tuner
This seems to be a pure mistake on Amazon's description. No other website that advertises this product says there's a USB port. There's just an AUX in jack that you could hook up your laptop, MP3 players, what-not. This was a major disappointment for me...Sound Quality: It is satisfactory, but just know that the boombox cannot handle bass from hip-hop/house/electronic music that well. There's distortion on the "loudness on" feature. I've been spoiled by really large speakers in my house, so I don't know how this compares with other comparable boomboxes. Also, for its size, I thought it could be louder, but again, I don't have much to compare to...Radio: FM is not picked up very well, except for the strongest of signals. AM seems fine.Look: Just know that it's big, and the image shown on Amazon makes it look a bit sleeker than it actually is. The AC Adapter is quite big and bulky.FINAL WORD: There just aren't very many boomboxes out there being made that look good and sound good. This comes close, and the AUX in jack is a nod to the fact that portable MP3 players are just as important accessories as are CDs, tapes. But it is big. I'm thinking of returning it primarily as I wanted to use a USB feature, but there aren't too many other options out there.

I bought this boombox for a kitchen that I knew needed to be loud. While the Hummer MusiXstation looks amazing and has pretty good functionality, the sound quality and volume is very low. To be honest, I wish it sounded like it looked. The radio is not very good at picking up FM stations, either. It does have a Audio in jack, which was very helpful and not available on a lot of other models.I was not impressed overall, and we switched back to our 1998 boombox in the kitchen.Pros: Looks amazing, seems durable, cool features (including audio in)Cons: Not very loud, sound quality is decent at best, subwoofer is a joke, digital FM radio not very receptive

Samsung LNS3296D 32-Inch LCD HDTV
I decided I needed a new TV for my room after purchasing a PS3. I moved my old Sony Trinitron into my mom's room and after months of painstaking research I purchased the LNS3296D. IT IS THE BEST 32" TV $$ CAN BUY!! Picture Quality is SUPERB, I can see the nose hairs and pores on everyone!! Every review I've read has everyone complaining about the sound but I didn't have any problem with it so those reviewers must have gone to one too many Rock Concerts. Getting an audio system with some good bass and depth would probably be good if you want to have the whole movie-theater-set-up experience. I have 10 Blu-ray movies and they are all jaw-dropping, mouth-drooling to watch on my new TV. I live in the center of Manhattan near Lincoln Center in NYC and recently purchased a silver Zenith HDTV indoor antenna to receive HD channels. Perhaps it's the fact that I am in a high rise building with a lot of other buildings surrounding me, but some of the channels don't seem to be too clear, however, the HD channels that do work are awesome!!!P.S. The shiny ebony outer frame of the TV is a fingerprint smudge magnet and it's hard to wipe off so when you get your new TV, please put on gloves, that's what I do now. Other than that, sit back...relax, and enjoy the ride.

Samsung LNS3296D 32-Inch LCD HDTV
We have had this tv for a little over three months and my wife and myself absolutely love it. Bright crystal clear picture and great looks, and best of all a great price from Amazon. Plenty of inputs. Standard cable looks great and hd programming is stunning as well as DVD's. I also purchased calibration software, but found that I really didn't need it. My settings were very close to the factory settings. We view in movie mode with the energy settings for the back light on low. I would recommend this tv to anyone looking for a quality set with an amazing picture. Sound is through a Sony 7.1 receiver with Polk Rt's and Infinity SM speakers, and a 100 watt powered sub, so I cannot give an opinion on the sound quality. When it comes to LCD's you get what you pay for, plus Consumer Reports rates this tv in first place as of FEB 07Paul S

Samsung LNS3296D 32-Inch LCD HDTV
I have owned this TV for almost three months now and I am still wowed by its fantastic image. I am quite picky about my electronics and this is the third HDTV I've had in my home. I've returned both a Samsung 50" DLP and a competitor's 42" LCD. Honestly, before I bought this model, I was scared I'd never find a TV that lived up to my quality standards. I took a gamble on this Samsung when I saw its price had dropped. Am I happy I made that purchase now!I'm an avid gamer, so response time and lag-free scan conversion were high on my list of wants. Quite simply, Gears of War looks unbelievable at 720p. I was hesitant of upgrading to HD because of concerns over losing the ability to play older games. You will want to make sure your consoles can output over component video (even 480i is fine, of course) or that you have some means of up-converting older inputs (my Sony stereo does a pretty poor job of this). But since the PS2 can render PS1 games (Final Fantasy IX never looked so good) and the Wii supports progressive scan GameCube games (mmm, Super Smash Bros. Melee at 480p) this has ceased to be a problem.I won't say that standard definition video looks good. I've heard that this TV is rated the highest among 32" TVs for SD video, but who buys an HDTV for SD television channels? I will say that 24 looks better in 1080i than my DVDs look at 480p. Watch the opening to House and you will become a believer. I also can't speak to this TV's 10W speakers. If you have the funds for this LCD TV, you already have a nice receiver and surround sound (or top-end two-channel speakers). I haven't had audio running to my TV in years. This Samsung does have a nice option for a hardware mute, so my TV speakers have never even been used. But I don't know, maybe this is a bedroom TV for you; it's not like any of its competitors have seriously better offerings for audio either.So, yes, this 32" LCD has a price that competes with some 40" LCDs. But for good reason; this is the best of the best when it comes to 32" TVs. And any 40" below $1500 isn't worth your money. I'm a hard sell and I have fallen in love with this TV and would recommend it without hesitation. Great job, Samsung.

I received this LCD for Christmas and it is awesome, the picture detail is amazing, and HD programming looks great. The speakers are so-so, but thats what surround sound is for.

I've had this TV for about a month now. If I didn't already have a Samsung DLP, I likely would have given this a higher rating. The picture is very good, but I agree that the sound is a little weak. I upgraded the sound with a Bose two speaker system and am happier with the package.I would say that I like my DLP better. I think the DLP has a much better HD picture and the hook-ups for the DLP were much better.I would say that this TV makes a great 2nd HD TV, especially if you are working with a small space to place the screen; however, for the money, I would buy a Samsung DLP for a primary TV and movie watching.

I was a sony fanboy before I investigated samsungs new lcds. I think that this LCD is top notch and compares well with the Bravia series of sony. SD picture ranges from very good to average. Where this TV shines is on HD broadcasts and gaming were the picture is nearly perfect, provided you tweak the settings (turn on energy savings, etc). Sound quality is average at best (10w after all). I would reccomend connecting a receiver. I gave this TV a five simply because the HiDef quality, good contrast and ample settings make the image beyond reproach. Unless your going to use this for SD broadcasts you cant go wrong.

Great video product. Very clear picture and easy enough to install. But the sound through the speakers is weak and sometimes needs the boost of a receiver/amplifier and external speakers to enjoy the video. Children in the 19th century were supposed to be "seen and not heard". Surely that should not apply to 21st century electronics.

Inspire 1080p (6.6ft) 2m Hdmi Ps3 Cable Certified
First off, for those that claim it does not work in 1080i, 1080p, you need to set BOTH units to the proper configuration. These cables DO NOT AUTOMATICALLY do it for you. No HDMI cables on the market can do that. In many tv's and dvd players, the HighDefinition mode must be set manually and even when that's done, the highest setting can only be achieved if both of the units support that resolution. For example, my Samsung player defaults to 720p, I have to hold down a button on the remote for it to change to 1080i. Go to Crutchfiled.com for more details, they have a great article on HDMI.I agree like most people here this cable is the real deal. It's hard to believe it's selling for single digit dollars while simliar cables at the retail stores are asking for $40-$120 each.As there are several vendors selling this product, I'm reviewing the one from ClearAV. I bought 3 of them for less than $25 shipped. The cables that came from ClearAV are apparently made by Inspire as it's stamped on the connector. Cables are all black except where the Inspire logo is (blue-green). It's flexible as any normal cable. I've read where some cables are too stiff.Connection tests:I have a brand new Samsung 4665 Full HD 1080p 1920x1080 tv. I connected the HDMI cable to the Sony Playstation 3, they both automatically detected the capabilities of each unit and saw that it was set to 1080p mode. Blu-ray movies were excellent. DVD movies were automatically upscaled to 1080p when I put in an older movie of Saving Private Ryan and the newest Live Free or Die Hard. Audio was transmitted correctly as the TV detected the presence Dolby Digital signal.Second test was with the same TV, but with a different player, a Samsung DVD 1080i player. Connected a 2nd cable to it and the TV automatically detected 1080i. Audio was streamed over correctly as the display screen on the DVD player showed Dolby Digital 5.1. Sound was just like it was before when I used an optical cable. Of course now, the optical cable is no longer needed because of the HDMI cable.With the successful results of the video and audio tests, I can conclude that all digital video and audio signals were apparently streamed over successfully. They appear to meet the HDMI 1.3 specs. I would ABSOLUTELY buy 3 or 10 more of these when I get more HDMI components. What a DEAL!

Inspire 1080p (6.6ft) 2m Hdmi Ps3 Cable Certified
I was at first concerned that a cable that cost so little (and probably what it should actually cost) may have some issues with quality. Be cautious of who you buy your cables from. I specifically bought these "inspire" HDMI cables from Clear AV for their quality. People have had alot of complaints over cheap HDMI cables not performing well with their Playstation 3 in full 1080p. This is not true with these cables. They perform just as well as the Monster cables some pay $50-100 or more for.I have noticed alot of confusion on how the HDMI cables are listed between all the various Amazon stores. Just makes sure you are buying them from Clear AV. You wont be disappointed and the customer service is great, which to me is more important than the products I buy.JUST GIVE THEM A TRY!!!These cables meet the latest standards in data transfer rates.Cables are pretty much cables but when it comes to HDTV/HDMI quality cables you need to make sure they are quality manufactured. Especialy since HDMI cables have specifications they need to meet. (Such as 5GHz and later technologies will need 1.3B Certified cables which these could very well be. HDMI is a later design of it's sister cable DVI; which was bulkier so you couldn't do in-wall installs, didn't carry HD audio, and a few other areas)

Inspire 1080p (6.6ft) 2m Hdmi Ps3 Cable Certified
After reading the reviews on this cable I went ahead and bought it. I though for only 5 bucks I can just trash it if it doesnt work. But I was wrong this HDMI cable made my PS3 experiance in 1080p possible. You will notice the difference as soon as you plug the cable up. On the PS3 you must restart the system and the PS3 will ask you if you want full optimal performance with a HDMI connection. I cant believe I almost bought the 60 dollar cable from sony, this cable is highly recommended with an blu-ray or ps3 system on a 1080p television. There is no point in having a ps3 and a hdtv without this cable.

Inspire 1080p (6.6ft) 2m Hdmi Ps3 Cable Certified
Works as advertised, full 1080p playback with new artefacts or issues. Not really much more to say then it does the jobe and is worth the incredibly cheap price for a full HD cable.

Inspire 1080p (6.6ft) 2m Hdmi Ps3 Cable Certified
We needed an HDMI cable to hook my son's PS3 to my 55" Samusng TV. This cable is an amazingly inexpenive way to connect HDMI devices. Why spend more? My son really likes it and it didn't cost me the big bucks like other cables.

Inspire 1080p (6.6ft) 2m Hdmi Ps3 Cable Certified
I was amazed to find out that this cable was so cheap and would work with my 1080p tv. Much to my surprise, the cable didn't respond too well to my tv and left me with black screens every so often. When I did my reasearch, I realized that not all HDMI cables are the same! If the cable is anywhere from $1 to $40, chances are it won't work well and isn't HDMI-Certified.Doesn't seem strange to only have to spend $1 on a High Definition cable when your tv and sound system probably cost around 3 grand?THERE ARE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HDMI CABLES! NEVER BUY A CABLE UNLESS IT HAS BANDWITH, SPEED, COLOR, SOUND, AND FREQUENCY RATINGS ON IT! Also remember, the longer the cable the less data makes it out of the other side!Watch videos on Monstercable.com to learn more about which cable is best for you and you tv.

ATI Technologies Radeon 9800 Pro 256 MB Visual Processing Unit
review/text: ... but did you also know you need it? Why? Because on a top end machine the following games have settings that go way past the limitations of even this card - Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004, Doom 3, FarCry and the soon to be released Half-Life 2. These are all new engines that will drive the games of tomorrow, meaning that I will probably be trading this one in for Xmas 2005 when the 512 line should make its mark. Anyway how does this card pan out?First of all it is a nightmare if you setup your card on a television and then forget to change it back for use with a monitor. So learn a lesson well about these monitor/television compatible cards. Make sure to change the Display Properties to whichever type you are using next because if you don't then you will not see anything and thus can not change it back. Next you need to know that these cards are top of line and make quite a great deal of noise. We are talking about listening to something like a 50cfm fan in your box doing the rounds. You are probably going to want to run your box cooler with these types of high-end chipsets running to get the most out of them so go searching on the net for a good environmental setup.All these new series of graphics card come with DirectX 9.0c or higher but the real key to unlock this God is with the new ATI range of drivers that enhance and accelerate the visual experience - CATALYST (Basically complete Real-time 3D immersive game play*). The four games for this card I have already mentioned (Playing it with Counter-Strike: Source is extremely good although I believe maybe a 128mb would give virtually the same playability for now). So if you want those games then consider this card.FarCry has an exceptional environment with something like X100 zoom on your binoculars. The enemy AI is unreal but in terms of graphics it is a real ride with this card. I believe you need this card for the full FarCry experience; however I do not believe that it pushes this card to its limit.MS Flight Simulator 2004 does push this card past it limits. Put everything up full in the details panel and look out the window over populated areas. You will see a delay and suddenly several sectors start to pop up. A 512mb card will make that game real-time.Doom3 has the ability to actually configure to a 512mb card if one existed now. Doom3 is an experience and a half, not 100% but unlike anything you have seen before and pretty scary to say the least. Anyway with this card the demon disintegration graphics are akin to watching someone getting beamed up in front of you. The lighting dynamics are also crucial to the game play. Get Doom 3 and this card and you will be stunned by something that looks like an XBOX 2 or PS3.Half-Life 2 is not yet released (Nov. 16th 2004 release date) but if you buy the new Bronze edition from Steam you can DL the encrypted HL2 files onto your HD along with CS: Source and Play Source right away which is a big improvement on any version of CS you have seen. Anyway it looks top spec on this card but I believe a 128mb card can play Source at it highest settings. Anyway the point is to look for the HL2 video and know that in reality HL2 is going to cost you $300 if you want the full experience.It's a tough cookie but let's face it. You have no choice. Now go work or Beg for it. We all did it!*As for using unsupported ATI drivers for this card. Well even Catalyst is unsupported (Use at your own risk from ATI sort of thing) so hammering around with this card is probably not a bad idea however it is always useful to do that after the card has passed its warranty but the choice is there is you want it. Personally I would stick to the ATI releases and get some good tutorials on your computer environment5 Stars but an XBOX is almost the same price.

ATI Technologies Radeon 9800 Pro 256 MB Visual Processing Unit
Due to the recently released Doom 3 and the upcoming Everquest 2, I bought this card for my latest computer build.Backed with 1GB PC3200 RAM and an Athlon 64 3200+ processor, this card rips though Doom 3 with all the effects on at 1024x768.THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THE BUYER NEEDS TO KNOW is that you should download and use the OMEGA DRIVERS in place of the Catalyst drivers that ATI gives you with the card (you'll need to search for them on Google, as I don't believe Amazon will allow me to post a direct link). It will save you a LOT of trouble, especially if you're planning on playing games.The Omega Drivers also add a bunch of useful tweaks that can enhance your video card. For example, RadLinker, which you can access by right clicking your desktop, going to properties &#62; settings &#62; advanced &#62; RadLinker, allows you to overclock your card with a simple slide bar. However, this card is functioning too well at it's current speed for me to risk anything/void the warranty, so I've left mine the way it is.

ATI Technologies Radeon 9800 Pro 256 MB Visual Processing Unit
having gone through a nightmare with an aiw 9800 pro (read my review on it, and you'll understand), i decided to take my refund and get a radeon 9800 pro 256mb for two reasons. one, i couldn't find any retailers with the x800 in stock, and two, brand loyalty. anyway, you can turn up the graphics on any of the recent 3d games and not have graphics-related issues. it's not as fast as the newest cards on the market nor is it as functional as the aiw 9800, and it's definitely not cheap. but if you can afford it, it's definitely worth it.

Super G with MIMO Wireless Laptop Starter Kit
Overall the performance is good, but some of the indicator lights don't quite work correctly. I was up and running about 15 minutes after unpacking, and about 5 min was digging behind my desk to get to my power strip. The unit works good and solved the problem I had with my old set up dropping my wireless connection every 10 minutes. That is why I spent the extra for the smart antena technology.The minor problems, the WAN and LAN lights only work if connected to a 100Mbps wired connection. My older cable modem and desktop have 10Mbps. Also the WLAN indicator is just a steady blink. I realize that it is designed to flash with activity, but this is a constant every second blink even with my laptop off and no wireless activity. I called tech support and after "trying everything" they told me to return it. I'm reluctant to do that since I finally have a reliable wireless connection, and I don't care that much about the indicator lights.Overall performace is good, just the minor problem with the indicator lights - which most people won't have, since I would guess very few people out there have the slow 10Mbps connections.

Sony VCTD680RM Remote Control Tripod for Sony Cameras & Camcorders
I orderd this tripod instead of the taller ones as the 57" height has proven to cover most, if not all, of the situations I would need it for. This tripod covers two of the most important characteristics of a good support, as it is very stable and solidly built, and it is also lightweight and easy to carry. The included carrying case also has a shoulder strap to make it even easier to haul.The big feature of the Sony tripods which separates it from the generics pieces, are the controls built into the handle of the head. They include play, stop, record, zoom-in, zoom-out, and take a still picture. Having the controls right at your fingertips on the handle makes it infinitely easier to control the camera and still keep a very stable shot with no jitter. I can rotate the camera, and zoom in and out, without any visible motion whatsoever. Sony's innovations and equipment integration is almost always worth the extra cost, and this tripod is no exception. I highly recommend this as the best tripod for any Sony prosumer video cameras.

Sony VCTD680RM Remote Control Tripod for Sony Cameras & Camcorders
The tripod is well built. Each leg has 4 sections, not 3. This tends to help with strength and stability. The controls on the handle make capturing video very easy. It is not a professional tripod built for 40-pound cameras, but it will very easily handle any Sony consumer video camera. The only minor drawback is that the speed of the zoom through the handle can be a little tricky to manage. However, if your are tired of the cheesey cheap tripods that sell for $30-$40, spend the money on this one. It is well worth it.

Sony VCTD680RM Remote Control Tripod for Sony Cameras & Camcorders
I purchased this tripod at Circuit City. When I got home, I decided to check the price here at Amazon.com and found it to be a total of 38.18 cheaper than Circuit City. I had already hooked up both my DSC-F828 still cam and my DCR-HC20 to it, and it worked like a charm. So I packed it back in the box and returned it... got home and ordered it from Amazon. I have yet to receive the product, but I already know I like it. Also love the shoulder strap and the fact that the tripod doesn't feel like it's going to fall over under the weight of my F828.

Sony VCTD680RM Remote Control Tripod for Sony Cameras & Camcorders
I bought this tripod for video tapping an upcomming family wedding and have tried it a couple of times to get used to it. I like the the smooth operation of the controls on the handle. The panning operation is likewise acceptable. The telescopic locking legs work well, but are light weight and can rock a little during panning. The lightness is also a plus because it collapses into a small over the shoulder bag for easy toteing. One hand on the tripod for stabilization and one on the control handle during panning works well.

Sony VCTD680RM Remote Control Tripod for Sony Cameras & Camcorders
This is a good general-purpose tripod for Sony Handicams. The remote control handle is a must-have feature for decent videos. With practice, slow zooms are possible.My biggest complaint is that the unit does not have a fluid head. It can be hard to get smooth pans without some jerkiness.However, the overall features and utility of the remote handle and a reasonable price, make this a good buy.

Sony VCTD680RM Remote Control Tripod for Sony Cameras & Camcorders
I recently used this tripod on a road trip to Yosemite. WOW! what a world of difference on my video quality. I tried other high quality tripods that I already had, however having the controls on the handle, make all the difference in the world.This tripod folds up in a snap! I then sling it with camera attached over my shoulder and walk to my next shoot.It is great to that you can turn off the power off to the camera, zoom, pan, record and even take stills during video taping, all without taking your hand off the tripod's handle.I am using this tripod with a Sony HDR-HC7 High Def camcorder.

Although I have not used this tripod for a serious recording with my old digital video camera, this tripod is not difficult to connect into my digital handycam.

This is an excellent tripod for Sony Video Camera. I am using this with my Sony Camcorder and remote is working pretty good. Its legs are strong. I am using the same with my Nikon D50( remote is not usable). And I am satisfied with the performance. only one issue is the base where you attach camera is plastic. So sometimes I am not comfortable with my DSLR with its zoom lens

This is a very nice tripod, is strong, elegant and cool, I love it, but the only trouble that I find it, it is that this cool gadget does not have a detail list of compatible sony cameras, I mean I am an owner of 2 sony cybershot camera`s, the W80 and H2 and I am not able to use the remote control with my cameras, only because Sony do not give us that information

Sony VCTD680RM Remote Control Tripod for Sony Cameras & Camcorders
This tripod is smooth. I know its not a professional tripod, but it is silent. I had other tripods that I purchased from Samsonite. Out of the box, they needed WD-40. This tripod is lightweight. At times it seems a little too flimsy, but it hold my Sony HDR-FX1 and my Canon XH-A1 prosumer camcoders.I had a special training I needed to record and place on DVD. Because of the squeaking of the cheaper tripods, I could hear EVERY move I made with that tripod. This is what prompted me to purchase this one.Others said that this tripod only works with Sony (as what Sony's website also says), but I found that to be false because it works my Canon very well... from the power to the zoom and record, it has no problems. Also, not having to even touch the camcorder cuts down on shifting and movement of the camcorder. I am going to buy another because I am pleased with the performance.

Sony VCTD680RM Remote Control Tripod for Sony Cameras & Camcorders
This product deserves a 5 star review. The tripod itself is very sturdy, supports a wide range of heights (including its lowest height which works nicely for macro shots), and it is light and compact (which makes it great for travel). Top that off with a great price, and you've got a great tripod. Here's why I gave it 4 stars:The product's accessory list is categorized incorrectly on Sony's website. If you look up the Cybershot DSC-N2, and click on it's supported accessory list, the VCT-D680RM Remote Control Tripod is listed (currently, as of writing this review). Furthermore, if you open Sony's description for the VCT-D680RM Remote Control Tripod, it directly lists the DSC-N2 as compatible.Note that the DSC-N2 is only HALF compatible. It will fit just fine on the tripod itself, but it will NOT work with the remote control features. The DSC-N2 doesn't have an ACC jack, which is necessary to make use of the tripod's remote control features on a digital camera. I've called up Sony and discussed the problem, and they agree that the product is mislabeled. They've been very helpful as far as customer service goes, considering the fact that I didn't purchase the tripod directly from them. They even offered a full refund on the product directly from them. Hopefully they'll update their website soon so this doesn't confuse anyone else.This is why I'm giving the tripod a 4 star review. The tripod itself is great, but the documentation is incorrect. On that note, this is still an excellent choice for a tripod. If you're willing to spend more money, you can upgrade to the VCT-1500L tripod, which will give you an extra 2 inches on the high and low end of the tripod, but I found that the VCT-D680RM gives me plenty of flexibility and travel accessibility, and saved me some money. Even without the use of the VCT-D680RM's remote control features, it's still an excellent tripod, especially at Amazon's price.

Great tripod from Sony. Remote control in handle works great, very sophisticated yet simple. I had a Vivitar tripod but it is not worthy and decided to stick to Sony (I own a TRV-70 Sony camcorder and I am buying a Sony digital camera Cybershot DSCH1 also from Amazon). When I received the box, it had an oppening, you could stick your hand inside! But I was glad that Amazon warns you in respect: "This item may be delivered in the manufacturer's original packaging, which could reveal the contents of the box". Everything in place. I want to give another star to Amazon for the speedy delivery although I ordered under Free Super Saver Shipping on the night of July 17th. Thought it would take forever but was surprised on the morning 22nd. In 5 days (with free shipping) I had it on my hands! Go Amazon

We purchased this tripod for one of the larger Sony cameras that we also purchased through Amazon. The camera is awesome. The page for the camera recommended this tripod so we bought it from Antonline. This tripod is not nearly strong enough for use smoothly with our camera and when I contacted Antonline for a refund they refused to deal with me, even if I paid the shipping back to them. If you buy this tripod, beware that truly strong remote control tripods can start at $300 and go up from there.

Three-section legs give good range adjustment and yet compact storage.Metal legs and adjustment clamps work good. Leveling bubble is somewhat helpful. The remote control handle work good with Sony products. The camera shoe is secure and tight. Panning with this tripod is a bit jerky and may not be appropriate for great video panning. Elevator mechanism is also jerky. Very good tripod for the money.

I found this tripod on Sony's website, but was a bit put off by the price, both there, and at Circuit City. I was thrilled to find it for much less at Amazon!!! The tripod itself is super... we mostly shoot video of our baby at home, so we don't need anything too sophisticated. We love the controls on the arm of the tripod, and the bubble-level thing is a good feature to have.Highly recommend.

Sony VCTD680RM Remote Control Tripod for Sony Cameras & Camcorders
This tripod is simply amazing. It is light-weighted enough (1.3kg or 2 lbs & 14 oz) that you would not feel burdened at all when you take it out for a hiking. Moreover, it works on other types of cameras instead of limiting it on Sony's products exclusively. I tried my 5 years old Olympus 2020 digital camera and it stayed there rock-solid. Keep in mind, however, that the attached remote only works with Sony-branded cameras/camcorders since the remote requires you to plug a cable into the equipment that you intend to use. I also try my newly bought Sony Camcorder Mini-DV DCR-HC42 and it worked flawlessly. The included air bubble was an ingenious device in that it allows you to see whether the tripod is level with respect to the floor. Thus, even if the floor is uneven, you can always find the best balanced spot by looking at the air bubble that's directly beneath the tripod's center leg. Like another reviewer said, this tripod gives the user almost unlimited control in that you can rotate it any angle you want, and with a range between 19 - 57 inches (or 48 -145 cm), it can almost satisfy any kind of everyday use. Finally, it was great to buy from Amazon because most people on ebay is selling roughly the same price, minus the great return policy from Amazon.I would absolutely recommend this tripod to anyone who needs it for any purpose.

Soyo 19" TFT LCD Monitor with Speakers
My friend bought this monitor for me (from Fry's Electronics) as a Christmas present. It worked fine until the screen started going black for no reason. I would just switch it off and then back on to fix that problem. But later I heard a "poof" and it went black, and then there was a burnt smell coming from the monitor. It is now dead (after less than 6 months of use). I will see what Soyo can do for me, but it looks like I am out of luck without the receipt. I know I'll have to pay for shipping, and I don't mind paying for some repair/exchange, but I hope they can work something out for me since their product was defective.**Update 10/26/07**After several calls/e-mails, it looks like SOYO is going to help me out in my predicament. I ended up talking it over with someone on the phone and he was very helpful. While I can't change the rating on this item, it does seem that SOYO customer service works if you stick with it. I will further update if there are any other developments.**Update**I received the new/fixed monitor after about a month. Costs to me were shipping the monitor, $5 standard charge by SOYO, and $35 missing receipt charge (so since it was a gift it was cheaper for me to do this process than to buy a brand new monitor). It works well, again, and I hope it continues to do so.

Soyo 19" TFT LCD Monitor with Speakers
I bought the Soyo 24 inch monitor based on a $100 reduction in price at Office Max and what appeared to be a review on the internet. Previously I had a Viewsonic 17" LCD monitor which was pretty bad too. The Soyo has a bad stand that is supposed to be adjustable, but I could not do it and had to prop it at an angle with a book. The User's manual is nearly incomprehensible. The speakers have to be the worst sounding ones I've ever heard. I am going to repack and try to return it and buy something better ever if I have to pay more.

This is a great product for the price! I have had this monitor now for 7 months and no problems. The only reason I have not given it 5 stars was the blue LED power light on the front is rather blinding but this is not a major problem. My solution to this was to cover it with a piece of electrical tape with a small pinhole poked in it. This allows you to still see the power light with no annoying brightness.

Sony VCT870RM Tripod w/Remote for Sony MiniDV, DVD, HDR-HC5 & HC7 Camcorders
Pros pay $600 and more (even much more)for tripod legs and head.The two main problems with cheaper tripods are lack of stability in the legs and "stiction" in the head movement. The lack of stability comes from lightweight, bendable legs. If you bump the tripod with your knee, or grab the handle without care, you'll see shake in the video. "Stiction" is the tendency of of the materials in the head to bind together slightly when left in a position for a few moments. The result is a visible jerk in the video when you start a pan or tilt movement. True fluid heads have a viscous fluid between the solid parts to provide smooth drag without binding.With the VCT-870RM Sony has somehow managed to produce an inexpensive tripod that doesn't stick. My pans and tilts are as smooth with it as they are with my 40 pound Bogen-Manfrotto legs and head.There is no getting around the fact that although well-built, the legs are lightweight. Therefore I have to take extra care to grasp the handle gently, and not to bump the tripod. But this is not hard, and it's worth it. It is so much easier to carry around the VCT-870RM than my pro tripod that it is almost always the one I grab when I'm going out for a single camera shoot. And I use it with expensive cameras--a Canon GL2 or a Sony VX2100.The controller on the handle is a totally unique and great extra. Being able to control the zoom from the handle gives much better results with much more comfort than reaching over with the other hand for the on-camera control. There is also a record/pause switch, a power standby switch and a still photo button. It plugs into the LANC control port on the camera. As mentioned above, Sony and Canon both operate according to the LANC standard, but Panasonic does not. I don't know about JVC.With the crank-controlled vertical column the tripod is able to attain more than enough height. I'm 6'2" and I only crank it up very little.I like it so much that I also bought one for my school's video club, and anticipate buying another. Highly recommended.

Sony VCT870RM Tripod w/Remote for Sony MiniDV, DVD, HDR-HC5 & HC7 Camcorders
I was a bit tenative about writing this review lest the world know our secret - and then they'd all have one too. We were looking for something to put under our PD170 and stumbled upon this beauty.The construction quality is solid and as a unit the tripod is stable. The fluid head panning is just about as good I could expect. Smooth and steady. The tripod shoe is nice and has a cork pad to protect the bottom of your camera.The tripod would be a good buy for just its basic features, but what sets it apart is the LANC remote control built into the handle. Its great. LANC (or Control-L) compatable cameras are made by Sony (this is a Sony product) and Canon and some others.On the handle you have a On/Standy switch, a Record button, a Photo button, and a Zoom rocker. For the stuff we've done so far its super. I can keep my hands on the handle get the shots I want.The remote control makes the makes using the camcorder on the tripod a slick experience.The only thing that would make this a better deal is if they added a Focus Control to the remote. As far as usage - the only other issue is it took a while to get a feel for how much to tighten the tilt knob to lock it down - i didn't want to over-torque it and break something and didn't want the camera slowly moving either - but once you get the feel its fine.This tripod is a good buy. But don't feel like you have to run out and get one. We like being the only cool and geeky ones.

Easily the best tripod I've ever owned, including some considerably more expensive ones. The only problem was with the remote. You must turn on the video camera before connecting. When the camera turns off automatically, disconnect the wire, turn on the camera, plug the remote back in. What a pain.

It's a great tripod with the features. Very stable but a little heavy compare to others. If you need to carry it a lot on the move, you'll have to deal with the weight issue. To be stable, it probably needs to be a little heavy.

Sony VCT870RM Tripod w/Remote for Sony MiniDV, DVD, HDR-HC5 & HC7 Camcorders
After reading the great reviews regarding the VCT870RM tripod (here and elsewhere), I decided to purchase one for my Sony HDR-HC1 camcorder.When I first opened the box, the VCT870RM seemed sturdy and well made. The tilting action was smooth and had a nice touch, and the remote controls on the handle worked well. However, the panning action was so stiff that while attempting to pan, the main column would twist and the handle would bend slightly. It felt like the tension control knob was tightened, but that was not the case. In fact, the panning continued to drag severely even with the tension knob completely removed.I recently found a VCT870RM review from about 5 years ago where somebody else was having the same problem with stiff panning. However, due to all of the other great reviews for this tripod, I'm assuming that I just received a bad one.I'm now in the process of working with Amazon to get a replacement sent to me. So far, Amazon has been great, as they've already scheduled UPS to come to my home and pick up the defective tripod the very next day. They say that I'll receive my new tripod next week. I'll post here on the status of the new one when it arrives.UPDATE: I received a new replacement VCT870RM tripod from Amazon, and this one works great. Panning and tilting are both very smooth, and the tension is adjustable. If I'd have received this tripod originally, I would've given it 5 stars. The first VCT870RM I received was definitely defective. I'm glad I returned it, and I'm glad I bought it through Amazon (best price at the time, and a hassle-free return).

Sony VCT870RM Tripod w/Remote for Sony MiniDV, DVD, HDR-HC5 & HC7 Camcorders
For it's price, which i in the mid-consumer range, and well below the pro range, it's a very nice little tripod.The legs lock firmly and are easy to latch and unlatch, the leg brace is at the bottom of the first set of leg tubes, which puts it off the ground even at the lowest height, overall manufacturing quality is very good--including the carrying case which is tough enough to last a while, unlike most such bags included with consumer equipment. It's a mid-weight nylon canvas with a self-repairing plastic zipper.I'm shooting with a moderately heavy camera (VX1000) at 4+# additions for a total weight of around 6-7#It is a LIGHT tripod. With the tripod fully extended it has a tendency to wobble a bit under the weight of my gear. Weighting this one in windy conditions or when shooting fully extended (especially with telephoto,) is a necessity.As others have noted, the zoom control moves the reverse of most camera zooms which is a pain to get used to, but can be gotten used too. (Hey LANC controls generally cost more than this tripod with it's controls!) If it continues to bother me, I may disassemble and reverse the control.With a lighter 1-2# consumer camera it is a VERY nice tripod, with less weight on top it is extremely stable.The carrying bag is very nice bonus. It's deigned to slip over your head and arm and run across your back--I'm 6'4" and have no trouble with it binding, and it is light enough to be barely noticeable. Very nice if you're traveling.As a consumer tripod its an excellent choice esp. if you are shooting with one of the newer small cameras, The LANC control helps stop a lot of camera wiggle and makes for smooth combination pan/tilt /zoom operations.The fluid head is of very good quality for the price, and has a nice range of adjustable drag.For heavier gear it needs added bottom weights outside, but works pretty well indoors.Besides the backwards zoom my only trouble has been that I accidentally hit the on/off button a lot--but that's mostly due to my height which tends to make me grip the handle in a choke grip.The LANC control should also be improved had they made the I/O a standard LANC plug rather than the molded relief permanent cable--it's too easy to forget to disconnect the cable when removing the gear, and I have some concerns about the longevity of that built in cable.THe LANC control handle is removable which opens up the possibility of using it from some distance away from the camera (I have a 20' LANC extension cable for use when the camera is mounted outside a vehicleI've shot about 7 hours of a documentary with it to date, and it has performed very well.I recommend it for consumer lightweights and reservedly recommend it for heavier prosumer cameras. You're not going to want to put a camera, lights, additional mic, transmitters and sound mixer on the head, but it does perform very nicely as a camera & mic support.

Sony VCT870RM Tripod w/Remote for Sony MiniDV, DVD, HDR-HC5 & HC7 Camcorders
I tried about 5 other tripods for my Sony HDR-FX1 video camera before purchasing this one. All the others had an issue with jerky motion when panning after the camera had been sitting still for a moment. With the others, there was always a slight jolt as you began to pan, which would ruin many shots. This Sony VCT870RM is the closest thing to a true fluid motion as is possible in a very affordable tripod. Having the remote operation on the tripod handle has made shooting much easier and provides better results because there is no awkwardness when trying to zoom and pan at the same time.True one handed operation of the camera. For being a lightweight tripod it is also very stable and it comes with a handy carry bag. It is well worth the price. I would recommend this tripod to anyone.

Sony VCT870RM Tripod w/Remote for Sony MiniDV, DVD, HDR-HC5 & HC7 Camcorders
The Sony VCT-870 is the tripod I bought. I think the LANC will also work with Cannon cameras.I like the fluid-ness of the head as there appears to be very little static friction. The pan and tilt are both smooth. The tripod legs are heavier and sturdier than the most expensive tripod I have seen in the electronic box stores or pro photo stores. I have been looking to buy a tripod for 2-3 years now and have not seen a pro-sumer version that I thought would be good enough for video. The legs are double extension with a flip-over friction clamps for quick setup and leveling. There is a built in bubble level at the apex of the legs. The center column extends up like most tripods out there. With everything extended I still get good enough stability. I am 6' 6" tall and it extends tall enough for me. The removable mounting plate has no slop in it. The mounting plate lever clamp is spring loaded closed but has an automatic trigger pin that keeps it open until the plate is inserted.With that said, I noticed several review saying the PAN function was too stiff. I agree that it is too stiff. If the tripod is just sitting on the ground, panning will cause the tripod to flex and wants to tip a little. There is no static friction, just high drag friction (this is of course with the drag control backed out). The TILT can have close to no drag at all which makes for difficult pan/tilt movements since the forces are different for each direction. I did notice that when the tripod warmed up in the sun for a while, the pan drag eased up a bit.The "work around" for this dissimilarity of drag is to add enough tilt drag to equal the pan drag. The drag control adjustment is very accurate and does not stick, bind or jump like the cheaper ones sold at electronic box stores. When I shoot a football game, if I securely strap the tripod to a handrail, the pan drag is not an issue at all since the drag will add stability to the shot. If the tripod is free standing, I grab the neck of the tripod with my left hand and the handle with my right hand. My left hand will add the needed stability to counter act the flexing or drag of the tripod while my right hand aims the shot. This provides more than acceptable results for shooting football plays since the action is fast and last for only 20-30 seconds at a time. If I were to shoot a theatrical event or a long slow shot, I think the panning might be more of an issue if you could not securely strap the camera down. It would be harder to steady the free standing tripod without adding a little occasional hand movement.The main reason I purchased this model was because of the LANC controller built into the handle. This controller is a TRUE variable speed zoom controller. A lot of the after market "clamp on" controllers have a zoom in/out toggle switch with a separate variable speed knob. This would be almost impossible to shoot a variable speed zoom in, stop, then zoom out as it would take juggling two controls with one hand. I have only used four of the functions - Power ON, Record Start/Stop, Zoom IN, and Zoom Out. The Zoom function is reversed from what you would intuitively think. To "push in" or zoom in you pull back on the controller. To "pull back" or zoom out you push the controller forward. After a short time of working with the controller you start to sub-consciously zoom correctly without having to think about it. The complete handle is easily removable and can mount on the left or right side of the tripod head. The controller/handle could be used to zoom or start/stop a remotely mounted camera such as a steady-cam or boom type operation with only a LANC extension cable.It was my intention to reverse the zoom pot to make it function the intuitive way. The pot is custom made with a flexible plastic multi-conductor cable. The pot can not be mounted backwards as it is built with a one-way snap in design. The three conductor plastic cable terminates with a four conductor end that plugs into an edge connector. You can not simply flip the cable over as the active three conductors will be offset and the conductive side would be opposite the contacts. The last possibility is cutting the circuit board and swapping the two outer leads. I have no problem with doing this as I used to modify circuit boards all the time in a previous job. The problem is that one of the outer conductors continues to other parts of the board and can not easily be bypassed. I gave up and decided to learn how to use it backwards. It did not take as long to get used to it as I thought it would.I would buy this tripod again if I ever needed another one. I would be willing to pay up to $200 for it as I see it as being a good $100 tripod with a good $100 LANC controller.The ONLY reason I did not rate it 5 stars is because the legs could still be a little stronger to counter act the pan drag. I would only rate something 5 stars if there were no room for improvement. I think it is a good compromise and good value. I give the value aspect 5 stars.

Sony VCT870RM Tripod w/Remote for Sony MiniDV, DVD, HDR-HC5 & HC7 Camcorders
The good:* Incredible value - a great tripod for the money* Solid construction. I don't have to baby it.* Head is marked in 10 degree increments making 360 degree stitch shots (for Quicktime 3d, etc). a snap (assuming your optics are centered).The not-so-good:* Some backspin at the end of pans, especially slow pans* The remote zoom in-out control on the handle seems backwards to me (push forward to zoom out.)* I miss the ability to quickly adjust side-to-side tilt from my el-cheapo unit.The verbose:This tripod is a fantastic value. When I first got my Sony HDR-HC1 camcorder, I needed an ultra-portable tripod for a trip to Asia. The one I picked up was about $40 and pretty wobbly, but it fit in my backpack and was suitable for static shots and very basic movements.Recently, however, I was asked by a client to do a quickie promotional video (my first time "doing it all" from concept to shooting to editing). After reviewing the results of my first day of shooting (mostly buildings and equipment shots), the limitations of my budget tripod were all too apparent. Pans were jerky, and camera shake was really bad, particularly at the beginning and end of shots as I started and stopped tape. That afternoon I ordered the VCT870RM for next day delivery.My next shoot was a night-and-day difference! The head provides very smooth vertical and horizontal pans. The tripod feels solidly built, has enough mass to be stable, but isn't too heavy to carry (I even got a low-end steadycam shot with it), and the integrated controls make life much better if your camera supports the LANC standard. I was able to get some great shots that utilized pan, tilt, and zoom all at once, and without any shaking.The only negatives I've found include a tendency for it to make a slight move in the reverse direction at the end of slow pans. I worked around this by holding a little pressure on the handle and making the end of the shot a little longer. Additionally, the remote zoom control on the handle seems backwards to me. You push forward to zoom out and backward to zoom in. I still haven't gotten used to that.In the "things to be aware of" category, this isn't an overly large tripod (though it can get the camera around 6' off the ground), but it isn't super small either. It comes with a fairly nice, unpadded carrying case with strap, but you're not going to be fitting it into your backpack between shots. It also doesn't have a side-to-side tilt, which my cheapo tripod did. I'd rather have to adjust the legs more often and get great image stability, however, than to have side-tilt and shakes.I definitely recommend this tripod for people new to video (and maybe even as a 2nd/3rd budget unit for pros) - it's amazing how much you can improve the quality of your shots for just a little more money. If I could give 4.5 stars I would (1/2 star deduction for the pan backspin).I'm extremely happy with this purchase and would get another one if it were stolen (or if I started doing two-camera shoots). I also have a suspicion that I won't be able to go back to a non-controller tripod anytime soon!For comparison:As I said, I'm a newcomer to video and don't have direct experience with more high-end tripods. The other models I looked at included the Sony VCT1170RM ($365) and a few different Bogen models. I didn't see an overwhelming reason to spend an additional $245 on the 1170, especially given the low weight of my camera, and I couldn't find an affordable Bogen that also had an integrated remote control interface. If you do go this route, Sony's RMVD1 add-on controller will run you about $35. I prefer having an integrated unit, however, as the controls are bigger, easier to use, and it's one less thing to lose.

Sony VCT870RM Tripod w/Remote for Sony MiniDV, DVD, HDR-HC5 & HC7 Camcorders
I purchased the VCT870RM after reading it was as good as a professional bogen of which I have five.It isn't, not even close, but it is a good tripod for the price, weight and size considerations and the built in lanc control is very nice.The tripod easily collapses to a nice compact size with flip locks (I like those far better than friction turns) and is very, very light.The lightness works against the tripod in regards to unwanted accidental motion, but is great for travel and moving around and this is an acceptable compromise in my opinion for many situations.I really like the built in lanc remote control (far less clumsy than add ons which I also own) with which you can turn the cam power on and off as well as the record (and photo) on and off, but most importantly it gives you a very controllable variable power zoom that allows you a slower zoom than you can manage with many of the newer Sony cam's on cam zoom controls.The mounting plate is large and solid and the built in turn key is far handier than those that require a screwdriver or even the bogen's turn knob style.The tilts and pans, while not as fluid or controlled as the bogens is completely acceptable.There is one negative, there is a slight resistance to any beginning tilt move (both up and down) which resolves itself at your end motion with a "resetting" just a tad back in the direction you started in.While you can account for this in your tilt motion to end where you want you cannot avoid the "back off" movement short of maintaining a manual rock steady(not easy to do)end pressure.This is disappointing as it makes the tripod less than ideal in situations where precise movement is desired often or continously.Considering this entire tripod costs significantly less than an add on lanc remote controller alone it is a very great value within it's limitations.For on the go I will use this tripod often, for critical movement jobs the bogens will remain the tool of choice.

When I purchased this tripod, my husband thought it was just another tripod. After he used it the first time, he guards this tripod with his life. He LOVE this tripod! The tripod is like a magnet because it always brings questions and people to the tripod. We have the Sony DCR-DVD505 and the remote on the handle of the tripod works GREAT with our camera. The height adjustment and everything was made perfect! We are not disappointed!

RE: SONY 870RM TRIPODThe fluid head is really fine for pans and tilts - exceptionally smooth for the relatively low cost.HOWEVER - the design and build of the neck (yoke) and leg assembly is weak. The unit I received actually "twists" as I pan the camera. Even with the leg spreader wide open, the yoke assembly that supports the legs at the top is just not adequate for the resistance offered by the pan head. I could try reinforcing the yoke by adding screws through it into each leg but I'm sure that would void the warranty.My $60. Velbon brand tripod is more sturdy in this regard however its pan head is not as good as the Sony and it it does not have the remote control.The remote control on the handle requires a "LANC" connection receptacle on the camcorder. It will start and stop the tape in the camera.The problem is with the zoom control. Although it allows you to smoothly vary the speed of the zoom, the design is backwards! The zoom requires the camera operator to push backward to zoom IN and forward to zoom OUT - the exact opposite of the zoom rocker switch on the camera!!! Totally illogical. I could get used to it but it's just another unnecessary quirk to put up with.I will probably be returning this unit or at least exchanging it for another in the hope that its legs don't twist.

This tripod is out of production, although I bougth it because the price and the need of lanc connection for my camcorder Sony DSR PD170, was the only model with a reasonable price. The desadvantage is that it can not hold stablity for the camcorder, too light, not enough hight, and the locks for the vertical and horizontal moves are not good enough, you loose in trying to loose or tight the buterfly nuts. The only advantage is the remote controller and the price. I hope Sony can improve it like the next level but with more confortable price.

I have purchased and used the Sony VCT870RM Tripod side-by-side with professional tripods for projects in Video Production Technology II, and its performance is equal to the professional tripods. The only difference is that professional tripods are much heavier. Still, this tripod is stable even in windy conditions, which makes it my favorite tripod to carry with me for projects away from the studio. Actually, I find myself using this tripod more than any of the more hi-end professional tripods in our studio. Panning and tilt are fluid, set up is quick and easy, and the quick release attachment makes it fast and simple to transfer my video camera on and off the tripod. The remote handle is ideal because it eliminates the need to touch the camera, which prevents camera-shake caused by having to depress the button on the camera to start and stop recording. If you want an excellent tripod that performs like the professionals without having to spend alot of money, this is definitely the tripod to buy.

I ordered this from Warehouse Deals as a returned unit. When I got the tripod, it was decent quality for the price, with the head being decently smooth and the legs were stable and a little stronger than others lead me to believe. Unfortunately, the LANC cable, which is what set this apart from other tripods, was obviously cut in half and not user-servicable, so I had to return the unit. I got a "full refund" which apparently means the price of the unit but not the shipping costs. Shipping a unit with a cut, external, and fairly obvious defect and not refunding the shipping seems a bit less than I expected.

This is both my first camcorder and tripod. So this'll be a newb review. I was using a standard tripod a friend let me borrow, which was not built for panning. Then I bought this baby and man! Smooth as silk panning left and right and up and down. Can shoot without seeing coverage "jiggle". It comes also with a black carrying bag with a shoulder strap with Sony tagged on it. When you put the camcorder on (mines a HDR-SR1), it has an easy platform you screw into the camera and just snaps on top of the tripod. I'm not really great at having a steady finger zooming in and out while panning the camera in your hand using my index finger, but with the tripod it's a little easier since you can use your "thumb" instead. Video game console controllers has a lot to do with that &lt;grin>. Other than that, it has a pretty sleek look colored with a metalic bronze intead of the standard silver everyone usually has. But definately, I was hoping for better panning and this nailed it. If you know another tripod that does that at less of a price, let me know and I'll get that one instead.

While not on the 'highest end' of tripod purchases, this one is a must for anyone owning a HDR-HC1 or other compatable camcorder. Operating the camera from the tripod (rather than the touch screen) provides steady footage for the amatuer videographer. The unit assembles easily and has stable panning and rotation. The only drawback is the soft storage bag which doesn't provide adequate head protection.

I bought this tripod to use with my Sony HDR-HC1 high-def camcorder. For the price, this is the perfect tripod if you own a compatible camera. Pans and tilts were smooth and adjustable. The quick release mount was nice, although you have to remove the mount to change tapes. This is more of a flaw in the camera design than the tripod design. The zoom lever also gave me more control over my zoom. I looked at other tripods at my local camera shops and they wanted well over $400 for a similar tripod (without the remote controls!). The included carrying case was a nice bonus as well (I didn't even know it came with one). My only complaint is that you have to remove the control arm to store it in the case. I can recommend this tripod for pro-sumer use.

Sony VCT870RM Tripod w/Remote for Sony MiniDV, DVD, HDR-HC5 & HC7 Camcorders
This tripod is sturdy and is taller than most which is important to me as i want my camera to be at eye level or higher. The cheaper versions with remote are shorter although lighter.The single biggest problem with this tripod is the remote control for the zoom. It is reverse of what would be intuitive. Pushing the buttom IN zooms OUT; likewise pushing OUT zooms IN. I even tried to rewire the switch but didn't find a way to do so. I had soder iron at the ready, but the fine ribbon cable was too delicate for the necessary surgery to make me rate this tripod high. While its no fluid head; the pans and tilts are fairly smooth. Smooth enough for what I use it for which is capturing my kids' sporting events.Lastly, for the price i'm willing to put up with the backward ergonomics of the zoom. You just have to 'think' about your zooms more than you would prefer to.Great price from the remanufacture site...

For some reason the power plug seems to be just a little off in size. Doesn't consistently supply power unless it is held in just the right position. Luckily, the USB connector and the power plug are connected by such a short cord that when the USB connector is plugged in then it pulls the power plug to where it needs to be. Works either plugged directly into Karma or plugged into the dock.

The compact Digital Grey Kard Premium is a nice, solid product. The flat toned white, black and grey plastic card stock should last for years, and it comes with a jazzy red lanyard with a snap disconnect. Product works nicely for neutralizing color casts in a scene (IF you remember to put it in the scene. D'oh!)I do wish the instructions were better or they posted a better YouTube video, for those of us without formal Photoshop training. Yes, you can find a few bits of data here and there on the internet, but it is a real fight figuring out how to use the cards with RAW files and curves. It is a breeze with jpegs, of course.

When reviewing your custom white balance settings its easy to check the levels of all three ( Grey, White, and Black ) all at once. I just fan the pack out and center on either the white or grey card depending on the balance I desire. Its also perfect fanned out for a guide shot to be used later in post to set grey, white, & black levels. Its small and easy to wear around your neck.

I am just an amateur photographer, but I am still pretty demanding with my photos. I use an 8mp Canon Digital Rebel XT, but have been having trouble getting some colors right, especially the reds. I tried every camera setting I could find but this did no good. I finally read about using a gray card to adjust the white balance. I didn't want to spend a ton of money on a card so I turned to Amazon and found this gray card from Digital Image Flow. This card is small enough to take anywhere and has done wonders for the colors in my photos, even the reds look 100% better. So now wherever my camera goes, so goes this great tool. I shoot mainly in raw format now because this card gives me the confidence that I can adjust the white balance to correct them if need be.

I think this is my first review in the years I've been on Amazon, but for once I feel that I need to speak out on a bad product.I bought both the DGK and theWhiBal White Balance Reference Card - Pocket Kit (2"x3.5")and I have to say that the WhiBal just feels better and feels that it will last a lot longer(the DGK cards are only about the third of the thickness of a WhiBal). However the Digital Grey Kard has one thing going for it, it has a superior laynard.I would recommend spending a few bucks more and get theWhiBal White Balance Reference Card - Pocket Kit (2"x3.5")instead.

Before I used this product I used white paper as recommended by Canon for my 30D. I put lines on the paper for focus and set white balance as custom. The paper was difficult to use and keep with me. Since buying the gray digital card, I have found it to be more accurate than white paper and easier to use. The digital gray card produces perfect custom white balance and works every time. It has a focus spot to get the correct image for setting up in-camera custom white balance. One time I used both the gray card and the white card (on the lanyard) and found the gray card produced the correct white balance over the white card. Now I never take a shot without setting the custom white balance to the gray card. I do this in-camera so I don't have to make adjustments in post processing. The gray card also gives the correct light reflection for digital camera exposure. Most books say the gray card should reflect at 18%, but that is not correct for digital. See article on the internet by Thom Hogan [....] who says digital camera makers set exposure meters to near 12% gray reflectance, 18% is based on printing standards. This gray card is closer to 12% and is very accurate.I like the lanyard. When I'm outdoors I keep it on my neck so I can periodically reset the custom white balance as I shoot. Inside under lights, I use it one time and I'm set for the shoot. I highly recommend this card for serious photography, and it is inexpensive as photo equipment goes.

As a retired negative wedding photographer, I want spot-on results. But with the digital age I had trouble getting exposure/white balance correct. Yes, the processor could correct for my "slight" errors. I did not appreciate how important white balance was, nor that it can change as easy as exposure. After a couple of tests w/this card. I was amazed at the skin tones I got. I used a drug store type quality (Costco) for convenience & speed and got great exposures! Just think what a higher quality firm (i.e. Dale Labs) can do with my files!Photo correction programs: Just use the "eye-dropper" tool; get color corrections- presto!Short comings: The cards could be larger! The instructions could be more detailed- The makers of this product could benefit from comments here!

I got this because I wanted a good quality gray card that wasn't made of paper and would last a while. I don't really need the white or black cards, or the deluxe lanyard (it really is nice quality though), and i basically just threw the card in my bag and left the rest at home. Kind of pricey for a piece of plastic, but if you are in the field shooting in JPG mode and need to do a custom white balance, it's worth it to me, even if it fixes just one shot. The card works great. I've used it several times already and it is a simple but effective way to adjust white balance in strange lighting situations.

I bought this set with risk (expensive & don't know if it work ok or not). Turn out I am SO HAPPY with this purchase.I did the card test:Took a picture of this set - Put this unbalanced picture to Photoshop to white balance it - Measure the balanced picture with Photshop sampler tool and find all RGB are equal; R=G=B. That's mean it neutral 100%.I did the camera picture test:Took serveral pictures with different light sets - white balance the pictures with this GreyKard tool. Result color in pix look very much match the real physical subject.So 5 stars for this GreyKard.Some notes, may be you like to read:This little GreyKard may not too great for doing Pre-Blancing for camera internally because it is so small in size. This GreyKard set is great for Post-Blancing using camera software or Photoshop. This is what I like for convenient GreyKard for Post Processing, reason: Post Processing allow me 2 choices (2 sets of image) to pick, First is the original pix; Second is the my white balance touched pix. Sometime the my white balance touched pictures turn the color look so real that make the people in my pictures look like "Living dead in front of a warm burning fire place" so I throw out the white balanced pictures and keep the original AWB pix.That is so good this GreyKard set. If some subjects originally look ugly, it will make it true ugly as original.

The three credit card size pieces of plastic work as advertised - they allow instant color correction in PhotoShop. They must be angled correctly or the glare from the flash appears white on both the gray and black cards.They are not large enough for me to use to set custom White Balance in my camera, but they are small enough to easily fit in my shirt pocket without any problems.This product will probably become standard in my portrait photography workflow, but I was a little disappointed when I opened the package - three credit card size pieces of plastic. My guess, and I may well be wrong, is that the packaging costs more than the product.

I had no idea how much post processing time this could save. My method is this; I have my models hold the balance cards where all three can be seen in the first shot of each lighting situation. I now worry much less about the white balance settings in my camera. Once the images are dropped into Photoshop I just click the selected eye droppers on the specific cards and my balance is set. Very easy to use.

The lanyard makes it easy to hang on the tripod, and it's an easy way to grab the cards out of your camera case. I don't understand why every gray card on the market has to be so expensive (for a flat piece of plastic that doesn't do anything), but considering that this is high quality and not one of the most expensive, I won't ding the rating for the price.This is my first gray card and I'm far from a professional photographer, but I did see a huge difference in the photos I've taken before and after adjusting my camera's white balance with the card. I don't see how my review says anything about this product in particular -- it's more of a recommendation to get a gray card if you don't have one -- but this is the one I picked and I'm happy with it.

I never knew how the white balance affected digital pictures. Without the right white balance your pictures could look blue and you not know why. Purchese these cards, learn how to use them and you can eliminate this problem. I am very happy with my purchase. Take care and happy photo taking.Walter Crawford

I like the idea of a grey card that travels in any of my carrying options; Pelican case, shoulder bag, knapsack or around the neck using the lanyard.I shoot with a Canon 7D, and I use these cards at the start of a shoot by taking an exposure of the white card or grey card so that the card is reflecting the same light as my subject. In order to get the optimal result, I switch the auto focus off, and try to fill the frame with the card, so that the resultant exposure is mostly the white or grey card only, while still reflecting the light I'll be shooting in.Next, I use the menu tab to go to the second camera settings tab (second red tab from the left), and use the scroll wheel to drop down to the fourth choice, which is "Custom WB". Select this choice, and using the shot you just took of the white or grey card, select the option "use WB data from this image for Custom WB". You'll get the custom white balance icon as you hit the "set" button. Once you've done this, select the white balance option and select the custom WB icon. Now, your shots will use the white balance based on the white card you've shot using the same reflected light that you intend to use for your shots. Repeat the process as the light changes. I generally take a quick few test exposures, and see how the custom white balance effect compares to the Auto WB or the other WB settings (such as sunlight, cloudy, etc) and almost always find the custom white balance to be more accurate.By carrying the cards around my neck on the lanyard, I look like a photo-geek but I have the color cards handy, to re-set the custom balance as the light changes.You can also do the method of shooting the cards at the beginning of a sequence, and using the exposure of the cards in Photo Shop to use the eyedropper tool to set white balance. However, I prefer to make changes as the light changes for truer white balance. Having the cards on the lanyard means that this option is always at hand.Nice product, cards can be used, abused and cleaned, and being on the lanyard, they're always handy to tweak your white balance as the light changes throughout your shoot. I find this to be more accurate than shooting a mess of pictures throughout the day in a variety of lighting conditions, and trying to force-fit all the white balance at the end of the day with the eyedropper tool in PS. I may be wrong in this, but so far I prefer to use the cards in this manner.

Sony VCTTK1 Pocket Tripod for Sony Camcorders
Excellent choice! My camera it's a 35mm manual so that means it's big and heavy and this tripod can easy hold it at different angles without loosing the aimed subject. I can carry it fold in my pocket almost without knowing compared with the other bulky tripod with legs that stick in your body. This is a universal tripod not only for Sony products; if your camera has a threaded hole underneath you can use this tripod. Good luck!

I bought this table tripod at amazon due to it's cheap price and unique design and ended up using it more often than my regular tripod due to it's portability. The rubber mounted legs fold flat inside its wide base which is perfect for camcorders as it provide better support than a typical table tripod. Tilting the camera is accomplished by moving the rear leg forward or backward, no more knobs to loosen and tighten, very clever design indeed. The quality is topnotch as one would expect from a Sony product. I highly recommend this table tripod for it's design, affordability and quality

The design is clever! It is cheap and handy. But note that it has to be put on a table. So it carries all the advantages of a tripod except the fact that it cannot be placed on the floor!! anyway, you can use it will all types of video cameras, it makes the camera stable all the time. Sony logo looks nice.All in all, buy it if you want a table tripod.

It's light, compact, and stable, easy to slip into a shirt pocket, and easy to use. It's great for fairly flat surfaces. From reading descriptions, the gorilla tripod (I think that's the name), while bulkier, is more versatile, since it can adjust for uneven surfaces and wrap around poles etc, but I haven't tried it.

Sony VMC-IL4615 1.5 Meter i.LINK 4-Pin to 6-Pin Digital Video Transfer Cable for most Sony Camcorders
Excellent method for transfering your videos to your computer for editing and making CD's. The i.Link cable is easy to use. Make sure you order the right cable. I ordered the wrong cable a 4 pin to 4 pin which I believe only works if you have a Sony computer. Most other computers like my Dell will probally need the 6 pin to 4 pin cable.Also make sure your computer has the capability before ordering. i.LINK is also known as Firewire and IEEE-1394.It does provide excellent high speed quality video transfers.

As a Mac user, I can just say that this cable is essential for anyone who wants to utilize the syncing features of iMovie with a Sony Handycam. The USB connector that came packed with my HC40 was completely useless when trying to connect to iMovie.This is essentially the reason I can't give it a higher rating than three stars. It was definitely frustrating to find that after investing in such a decent personal-use camera, that Sony expected me to buy still more of their stuff to make it even connect with my computer. If I had to purchase it at the ridiculous Sony retail price, "frustrating" would've been too mild a descriptor, but Amazon's discount helped soften the insult.Beyond that, I can't say a whole heckuva lot about it - it's a cable, after all. Ha!

Works as described. I am just so annoyed that Sony would lure me into buying their video camera for a competitive price without including this cable, making the overall cost of the camera no longer competitive. It's smart for Sony to conduct business this way, but only in order to earn profit in the short term. You can bet I won't be suckered in to buying any more Sony products in the future, now knowing that this is how they run their business.

This is just another way for Sony to make another $35 on the purchase of their Video Camera. Imagine my surprise finding out that I had to purchase a separate cable in order to create DVD's from my DV camera. As far as the cable itself goes, it is fine. But, it sure would give Sony more favorable talk on my part if they just included the cable when I buy the camera.

Cable is sold as having the ability to transfer video from a camcorder to a PC.It doesn't do it. I spoke to the company and they told me that there is no cable that does that. I asked them why thet advertised this cable as being able to do it and he told me I should have known better. They then charged me 15% to take the cable back. You would be smart to shop elsewhere. They don't know what their products do and they charge you for their lack of knowledge.

It worked for about a month. Even when it did work it was a hit or miss thing. I had to fool with it for a while. Maybe it was because I bought the cheapest one available. Maybe it was a knock-off, who knows? I have yet to try it on another computer to rule out it not being the cord. Fair warning.

The cable works great. I have been uploading Digital8 video to my processor for editing projects with no problems. The cord could be a bit longer than its 1.5 meters but that's not a major concern. It was a bit pricey, but the steep markup on cords is pretty common across the board. All in all a good purchase.

I spent a couple hours, trying to get transfer DV from my camcorder to my mac powerbook. After hours and hours I had to realize that the USB cable delivered with the sony camcorder was absolutely worthless. If you don't own a sony VAIO (which in my opinion just a overdesigned peace of fancy 007 gear with an i.Link connection, which no other PC/MAC has)your getting frustrated pretty quick. I would have given the cable a 5 star rating, but the way I had to get the cable, by having to buy it seperately, is a big rip off. However I found the exact same cable in an apple store called "Thin Fire Wire". The exact same cable (1.8 Meter 4 to 6 pin to be exact) for only $29 and it works just fine. So check out an apple store near you and save some money.Shame on you Sony.

I bought this to replace the cheap one I have which comes with 8 different usb tips, 1 of which doesn't work. Instead of having the same variety of tips as mine, it come with 6, 4 of which are 2 telephone and 2 network jacks. The extension cord had too much thought put into it. Instead of the regular "zipit" type cord, this is bigger and has both ends of the cord coming out the same side and uses a button to retract the cord. Not a problem just doesn't work for me. The tips are well made and is of sturdy construction, I think the pouch is just stupid. Fortunately I can mix and match the two to cover all of my needs.

Canon ZR40 MiniDV Digital Camcorder with 2.5" LCD, & Digital Still Mode
Yes it does eat tapes. I have the camera and I have owned it for about 3 years. It did some fine work. I have no complaints except if you need a camera that will never eat tapes, be very wary.I posted my movies on a couple of websites. I make short movies. I used the Canon ZR40 and made movies with the Sonic Foundry Vegas 4 editing system. It made fine movies in the wmv or rm or mov for Quicktime web formats. My short films are at hollywoodscreams and myhollywoodstar and those are dot com, of course. They are family friendly.Recently I tried to rewind a tape. It got mangled. I figured it was just the tape. I tried a second tape and another. Each time I would record something OK but the tape would get jammed during rewind. On the movie Hollywood Screams I rewound each scene by hand. That is very hard to do. I had to use two toothpicks to hold the cassette lid open so I could pull the tape out and then wind the spool by hand. It was very time consuming.The video looks good and I never noticed noise. I am sure each brand of camcorder has some problem. Canon has a mechanism that mangles tapes in rewind after several years of use if my camcorder is typical.Tom Willett

I have this camera and I noticed two things that were kind of annoying:When you play back what you have recorded you clearly hear the cameras motor in the background, so you should use an external microphone. Even [an inexpensive] one (like the one I use) has better sound quality than the cameras internal mic.Also, the manual is VERY vague on the cameras specs. I edit my video on a PC and there is a lot you need to know when uploading video via FireWire, like if the camera has a 4-pin or a 6-pin port, if it is NTSC or PAL, that sort of stuff that you MUST know in order to upload.Overall, this is a very good camera, just with some minor flaws.

I just purchased my ZR40 and I think it just barely gets by. The still photos are very grainy and in low light scenarios it does not perform well. The digital zoom is out standing, and it is very handy. I&#65533;ve only had it one week so I can&#65533;t say every much yet.

Up until tonight, the ZR-40 seemed average to me. It's pretty small, has high video quality etcetera, but doesn't have many effects or features. Tonight, however, our family puppy knocked it off of the TV (about 4 feet above the hardwood floor) and dragged it around after him by the power cord as he ran away panicking. After a thorough inspection and runthrough, I found NO damage to the camera, and only a slight bend in the TV interface plug where he'd ripped it sideways out of the camera. If you're not sure you can protect your camera from all harm, I'd suggest this camera - it takes a lickin' and keeps on tickin'!

I'm always been fond of the Canon line of consumer DV cams. They always have great optics, electronics, and durability. But what really sets them apart is thier menu systems! It's totally disgusting that on most any other brand, including ones as prestegious as Sony, that they lump all the menu options into a hoard of small, finger nail sized, buttons for most of thier consumer models. For Canon's you simply press the menu button then scoll and press a togele wheel. This way, once you get the hang of the wheel, you now understand how to use the whole menu system for any function. This is a great improvement over those that require the manual to find that "secret button combination". This is a consumer camera but I use it for many large applications. It has been sized down from it's Optura and Ultura ancestors but pretty well all the functionality and then some. It has other sister cams such as the ZR45MC and ZR50MC. These pack the all-in-one memory card digital camera and mini Dv. I have friends who love these models dearly. Personally I go for a seperate camera with larger resolution. Whatever your needs are ...I've noticed a large number of reviews that say something to the affect of "I pulled it out of the box, plugged it up, and the image was grainy" or "I turned on steady shot and nothing happend".This might be old news for most but to explain for those of you that might be concerned by this ...Video cameras these days still thrive on ample lighting! This and other cameras have a sort of slow motion low light mode (accessible from the menu) that works by slowing down the frame rate and sucking every bit of image data off the CCD. THis is ok for an emergancey but if you want good image, turn on an extra light or two. Human eyes are so adaptable that you might not even notice if the lighting is more subdued than usal but it will make a mile of diffence for the camera. Secondly, get to know the manual menu and exposure system. The auto functions can't always guess what your trying to do.About steady shot... this only takes of the headache inducing shock that occurs when you jar the camera. It's extremely useful in it's own right but it won't keep you from waving the camera around.This is a great cam that I fully recommend. THere is one issue that doesn't dampen my five star rating but is noteworthy. To size this camera down to an even more portable size, the engineers made it with the DV cassette loading from the bottom instead of the top. THis is fine except that if you are a true believer in tripods, as I am, then you have to take the camera off the tipod or tripod plate every time you need to swap tapes. Just a minor concern...

Canon ZR40 MiniDV Digital Camcorder with 2.5" LCD, & Digital Still Mode
Expecting a baby, I did research for about three weeks before I ended up with this Canon ZR40. Couple of features that I wanted to have were external mic input, analog input, no still images since I already own a nice digital camera, and most of all, affordable price tag. Amazingly, ZR40 had this all! 18x zoom is nice and its compact size is pretty neat. Still, I have minor complaints after extensive tests.1. As pointed out by many people previously, the picture is somewhat grainy specially indoors. Because this is my first digital camcorder, I don't know if this happens for other high-end models, but I suspect it may stand out somewhat more for ZR40 with only 480K CCD pixels.2. What has also been noted was the motor noise, which is my primary concern for now. Maybe, I would not been able to tell if I had not read those reviews, but I could certainly hear the noise when recorded in a quiet environment. I tried to use an external microphone to remove the noise, in which case the noise is gone, but the external microphone does not match the internal microphone in sensitivity. (I used a low-end microphone for the test with the sensitivity of -75 dBm, though.)3. This is a really minor point, but the camcorder automatically shuts down if I don't start recording within 5 minutes.Overall, I think ZR40 has great features at such a price and is certainly worth owning if you are looking for one in the price range.

Pros:1) 18x Optical zoom. I can clearly see the faces of people sitting across an indoor stadium. Don't settle with 10x on many similar models!2) Size. Very comfortable and easy to hold for an hour, but heavy enough to prevent 'shaky hand', and not too small for big hand.3) Image stablization. It actually works, especially if the objects don't move a lot. Very important if you go near full optical zoom.4) Shooting modes. I tested both low light and spot light modes in a very low light indoor stadium. Spot light works like a charm, if you don't want to see the audience at all. Low light let you record everything, and the video is grainy yet acceptable. Overall, shooting modes work as advertised.Cons:1) Motor noise. The microphone picks up a LOT of motor noise, and this can become VERY annoying if you are recording in a quiet environment without a lot of background noise. Taping a sleeping baby in a quiet bedroom? forget about it.2) Color. The color often looks 'untrue', especially outdoor under stronger sunlight. On the video, trees and grass often are not nearly as green as they actually are.3) Battery life. The battery only last 50 min with LCD on half of the time. Replacement battery cost quite a bit.

I have had my ZR40 for a week now, and it has exceeded my high expectations.The 18x optical zoom is phenominal. I can read the headlines on a newspaper two blocks away, or a number in a phone book 20 feet away.I was impressed by the camera's ability to perform in low light conditions. In my poorly-lit living room, I exerienced no graininess or loss of quality.I took the camera outside 30 minutes after sunset and was still able to record satisfactory video.Hooking the camera up to my TV for playback was very simple. Recording off my VCR was also very straight forward.The remote control (which wasn't mentioned in Amazon.com's review, BTW) is handy for recording our nephew who gets shy when he knows he's being filmed.I recorded in some quiet settings, but was not able to hear the electric motor turning the tape or adjusting the lense when zooming. If that's a problem, it's easy enough to hook up an external microphone to the ZR40.If you get this camcorder, don't forget to claim Canon's free ShowBiz video editing software (see their web site) with proof of purchase. (I haven't gotten it yet, so I can't rate it now.)

This is really the ideal entry-level camcorder for someone just getting into digital video editing. The optical image stabilization is far better than the electronic kind, and the picture quality is pretty good. It has a tendency to overexpose in bright sunlight, but you can easily adjust the exposure down half an f-stop. It's small and light, the viewfinder and flip-out screen are both color, battery life is pretty good with an add-on high capacity battery. Best of all, you can connect your old analog camcorder to it and import all your old videos to DV! Works great with Apple iMovie.The one downside to this camcorder is the audio. It's a problem with most tiny cameras, and this is no exception: motor whine. DV requires a high speed rotating head, which means fast motors--and because of the small body, they're too close to the built-in microphones.My solution was to spend an extra $99 on a Sony WCS-999 Wireless Microphone kit. It's a clip-on belt pack with a "tie clip" style mic, operating via 900MHz wireless. Just like professional TV presenters use, but at a fraction of the price. After that investment, I got great sound.

Unfortunately I had a very bad consumer experience buying this camera. I had borrowed a ZR20 from a friend the year before and liked it, so when the ZR40 came out I wanted to buy it. I read online that some people were complaining about motor noise with this camera, but I figured I try it anyways. I bought it at Best Buy (should be called Worst Buy), and when trying it out found that it does have super bad motor noise. You can't hear it while recording - it's when you are watching a tape you recorded playback on your TV etc that you hear it. The motor noise is recorded in with your audio, so you hear a loud hummmm in the background. It was too loud for me to live with. If I was recording something with no background noise (like my baby playing), then it was as loud as his voice! ... I have now ordered the Panasonic PVDC152 which is supposed to have good sound. We'll see...

We have had the camera a week and did some taping indoors in a quiet room. When we did the playback through our television the sound was awful. The noise of the motor on the tape is very loud and distracting. We have heard better sound on older VHS camcorders. Is it because the camera is so small? Is there a fix for it? This has yet to be determined as we plan on calling Canon about it. We have read other reviews of other Canon models and also similar Sony camcorders with the same complaint. Sorry, but for this much money the sound is totally unacceptable. If you buy it we recommend taping a short bit and hooking up to your TV to see how it sounds before it is too late to return.

I did extensive research on this model (the whole ZR series) and I must say, a lot of things are positive for this little camera.* light weight, * small, * bright outdoor pictures, * PRICE.And some negative points raised by many so far, which of course I have not been able to test as I have not bought this item, is the motor noise being recorded and the night shots being grainy.I will not discuss anything about it as they have been beaten to death by now.What I want to talk about is the smaller CCD resolution on the ZR series camcorders.As we know, the US spec ZR series have the 460K pixels, out of which only 290K pixels are used for video (effective pixels). We need about 420K effective pixels to get a 500 line video resolution on the TV. Most of us know that, the VHS format (video tapes) allow upto 240lines of horizontal resolution. The S-VHS tapes allow upto 400 lines and the Digital Video format goes to 525 lines (really crisp and sharp pictures) on the TV/visual media.So now, with mere 290K effective pixels of video resolution being recorded on the ZR40/45/50, the best lines of resolution would be around 300. Now, not everything is bad. If you intend to transfer your videos into VHS tapes for storage and future viewing, you will not have any complaints as VHS tapes store at 240 lines of resolution. But someone like me, who wants to store the video digitally, by burning them into DVDs or storing them in DV tapes, I would like to get the best resolution that I can, right?In simple words, I want 500 lines of resolution for my video, full stop! Even though ZR40 is a DV camera, its resolution is very poor for real digital quality video.By the way, the resolution has got everything to do with what we call SHARP, crisp and colorful pictures. It is the same difference you see between the movies played from the VHS tape and movies played from the DVD.Oh by the way, if your TV doesn't have a 500 line horizontal resolution capability, you are not getting the money's worth by renting DVDs. The TV I bought about 4 yrs ago, a proscan 32 inch, has 700 lines of horizontal resolution. So I can assume most TVs in our houses have capable enough TVs. Going slightly off topic, do you know why the picture quality of HDTVs are so sharp? Bcoz their resolutions are almost double than the 500 lines I am talking about.

This is an excellent camera, and if you're going to be using this camera with a computer for edited purposes, you don't need the still shot feature that the more expensive cameras have, because you can just pull any still shot you want out of the footage once you have it uploaded. The picture quality is great, it's lightweight, and I was very pleasantly surprised by the audio quality, even out of the built-in microphone. It's one of the best deals in video cameras I think. I would recommend a spare rechargable battery though. It doesn't last very long.

I almost passed this by, because of the motor noise many people mention. But the price is unbeatable - do a good internet search and see for yourself. You do not pay for useless features, like magapixel stills - who needs 1MPix digital stills anyway - any digicam is at least 2 MPix? There is some noise; however I compared it with a friends Digital8 camera, and it also had some noise, although Canon's is more high pitched (but not noticeably louder). It might be that the noise is amplified during playback on the camcoder - I only import digital video on my computer for editing and I really have to look for noise in order to notice it.I am totally happy with the camcoder.

I bought this model 18 months ago. Now it has big problem. I can't rewind the tape well. "remove the tape" mesasge always pop up. I sent it back to Canon for repair. They asked me $169 for repair. What can I say now? Too bad camcorder.

Canon ZR40 MiniDV Digital Camcorder with 2.5" LCD, & Digital Still Mode
I've had this camcorder for almost half a year now, and I have no major complaints whatsoever.After doing research for Sony, Canon, JVC, and Panasonic, I finally settled on this one and have not been disappointed.The camcorder itself is easy to use. It took only a quick glance through the manual and I was well on my way to videoland.The minidv tapes are pricey and this records in SP (60 min for regular tapes) and LP (90 min), so you'll want to check those out before buying.Hooking up to TV requried several tries the first time for some reason, but now I have no problem.No software comes in this package, but I tested this with several, including Windows Movie Maker, Ulead VideoStudio, MGI VideoWave, and the $...rebate software ArcSoft Showbiz. Depending on the program, the video takes up different amounts of space on your hard drive, but just for the record, using MGI VideoWave, a 4 min clip took up 875 MB (yes, that's right.) However, Windows Movie Maker take up only a fraction of that. I haven't explored making VCDs due to the limited memory on my computer (Win ME) but it should go smoothly.You'll find that the zoom allows you to read the text on a newspaper up to about 30 feet away clearly, and that this product is sturdy, reliable, and has excellent value.I think the new line of Canon camcorders has come out already, and if you are thinking about buying one, don't hestitate: it's the best deal out there!

This is a great first digital camcorder. I bought it to upgrade from a Hi8 camcorder, and to use it to convert my Hi8 film to digital. I have had no problems using this camcorder to convert my Hi8 film to digital, and burning it onto DVDs. Send in for the Showbiz software for exceptionally easy movie making.Con: The motor noise is there, but is easily overcome with a camcorder microphone. There are many inexpensive microphones out there to choose from.

Well where do I begin? After a month of use, the battery stopped working. Contacted Canon via email. They replied battery is not under warranty. Would you like to buy another one? Please.6 months later. I started transferring video to my computer only to find out this stupid camera eats tapes. I have lost two tapes so far. One of them was my son's birth!!!!The eating tapes issue is a major problem with this unit. They have known about it and continue to ignore it. Do a search on "zr40 tape problems" to see what I am talking about. There are even more results on sister product, zr10. I will never buy a product from Canon again. They are idiots for doing this to their customers.

Excellent camcorder, does very well in all kinds of light. I have had no trouble with it indoors, and I find that it performs very well in low light. Flawlessly performs with Windows Movie Maker 2 through firewire. The sound is outstanding, considering the picture is it's strong point. I did not need the digital camera built in as I already have one. Effects are fun to play around with, especially with the handy scroll button. I have not heard the motor noise at all, so I can't see where that is coming from. My only complaint is that it shuts off too quickly if inactive, but it's really not that much of a problem. Image stablizer works really well, as I often have an unsteady hand but it is hardly noticeable with this camcorder. I just wish they made a VCR that could record the footage as well as it was taped!

I bought this camera after reading many reviews talking down the microphone and the battery life. I have not noticed a problem with either, yet. I am primarily using the camera to record middle school music performances with a tripod and AC adapter. It worked just fine to get the music, although I had a harder time hearing the adjudicator's comments at the solo &amp; ensemble festival. I may invest in an external microphone, but for now I'm happy with the results.

As many others have reported, this Zr40 began eating tapes with only a few hours of use on it. I have lost many precious moments recorded on tape because of the tape loading problem.The only good thing I can say about this camera is the bag was large enough to hold my Nikon P100. The Canon is going in the trash.

I own one of these cameras and it has very low hours on it. The transport mechanism has failed and will not properly load and play tapes. Not only that, the tapes now appear to be damaged for playback on another machine. I have owned many Canon products and have been satisfied with them, but this unit at $600 should be avoided.

Things I like...- price- sizeThing I didn't like and made me return- performance under regular indoor house lighting very grainy and considerably worse than my 8mm analog. Doing further research it appears this is likely not unique to Canon but common to DV camcorders. I am going to stick with my 8mm for a couple of years until DV tech improves since much of my use is indoors filming kids, etc.

After about a year of use, ZR 40 started eating tapes. Do a google search on the topic, there are hundreds of people with the same problem. 'Remove Cassette' and 'Eject' (use those as keywords combined with 'Canon ZR' to view message boards postings) will appear on the screen, and that's the end of the toy.

I just received my ZR 40 and really liked its size and low weight. But once I tried it, the fun was quickly over. Low light recording (in my apartment with lights on) was horrible and even with low-light mode selected, it was unacceptable. And in night mode, everything moves in slow motion. Overall, the quality was not that great, even in day-time shooting.I have a regular Sony Hi8 cam, and its low light and night capabilities are 100 times better. I would seriously hold out for a better camera, even if it costs a bit more.The image stabilization also makes the picture look strangely un-lifelike.

I bought this camcorder to replace an aging 8mm GE unit that I've had since '96. I can't believe how far technologies come in such a short time. The video is amazingly clear with the optical zoom (although it does get grainy when the digital zoom kicks in) and quality is good in many lighting conditions. I just got a firewire interface and even though I'm only using the two "(inexpensive) and free" software packages (the firewire card came with ULead Video Studio and the Canon comes with ArcSoft Showbiz), I'm having a blast editing video with my computer (in near realtime). Quite a difference than just 4 years ago when I was using a Truevision Bravado card and my 8mm (Quality was never that good and it took FOREVER to preview/compile video).

I've had this camera for almost a year now. I'd say that all of the features that I would expect from a digital camcorder meet and exceed my expectations.Things that I like the most:1. Perfect companion for my iMac.2. Great quality analog-to-digital conversion. A must if you want to play with analog videos in digital world.3. Solid Canon design, made in Japan if anyone cares.4. Price.5. No useless features like in more popular brand.Things I don't like as much:1. I think indoors quality is reasonable but it's average with low light. I don't really know if any cameras in that price range do well in low light.2. Some people complained about motor noise? It's possible, I haven't tried to make any silent movies yet. I add music to all my movies that don't already have some sound.3. Battery life is short but recharges quickly.4. Shuts off quickly if idle.5. You probably wouldn't want to use low-resolution Photo feature espesially if you have a good digital camera but this is probably the only "useless feature".If you are like me and just like to point/shoot/watch on tv/edit on your computer - it's great.

Love this little camera. Video taken outside is outstanding, inside can be a little fuzzy without bright lighting. Zoom is fabulous. The only thing I don't like is the fact that you can only charge the battery while it is mounted to the camera, which defeats the purpose of having multiple batteries if your wanting to have one battery charging while still using the camera with another battery.

I have used the camera for a month and am impressed by its features and picture quality. I agree with the other reviewers that indoor shoots require good lighting.

If you go to several discussion groups you will see it has several issues with the deck, i.e. "transport". Just google zr20/40 etc. and "eat tapes". Suggest you try Sony or Panasonic.

Can you tell me if this firewire/i.LINK cable will connect properly to a digital8 camera, from Sony?

Since I am seriously considering purchasing a DCR-TRV280 Digital8 Handycam I need to know what I have to get for the best ease of use.This was confusing though because the wire is not included in the purchased material, and it does not indicate which wire should be used although it does say it can be.

I ordered the Sony 4Pin to 4Pin Digital Video cable for my Sony digital camcorder and it came with a bent pin in one of the connectors. I specifically ordered the Sony rather than a generic one because I thought it would be more likely to be of higher quality. It was advertised as new. When I plugged it into my camcorder it did not work. On examining it I found that it had a bent pin. When I looked at the camcorder connection I found that the bent pen had ruined the connection in the camcorder. What a bummer. I contacted the seller and they were willing to send me a replacement for the cable but took no responsibility for the defective one ruining the camcorder connection. I did not bother to get another one for obvious reasons.

It took me awhile to figure out that this was the cable I needed to make it work, and the people at Best Buy weren't any help, so I ended up buying an S-video cable they recommended that didn't complete the connection before I found this correct one I needed buried in the literature.

I was trying to resolve a technical issue with a TRV-950 Sony Handy Cam but the cable I received seemed to work between cameras but didn't solve the issue with capturing to Sony Vegas Pro 8. There is something I can't figure out with the 950 so I have been using my TRV-900 and Ulead to capture video then importing that into Vegas for editing. If someone reads this and knows how to get a TRV-950 to capture to Vegas Pro 8 directly please let me know.

Wilife DLC810E LukWerks Outdoor Add-on Camera
I have 2 outdoor Lukwerks cameras and 2 indoor cameras. I've had them since September 2007. They were easy to set up and the new software (version 2.5) seems stable with fewer cut-outs.However, I've had hardware failures. Within six months of purchase, both power supplies to my indoor cameras failed. Replaced.In June, 2008, one of my outdoor cameras died. I contacted customer serviced and gave the information. Three days later, I got an email from Lukwerks tech. support with an RMA number. I packaged the dead camera and sent it in. About 10 days later, I received a replacement. In all, I was without the camera for about two weeks, but I DID get it replaced.In July, 2008 my second outdoor camera failed. I have not yet had it replaced. I purchased it in June, 2007, so it'll be interesting to see if they will replace it since the warranty is only 1 year. I will update when I have further results.All of these hardware failures are troubling. I speculate that it is caused by electrical noise or surges that are frying the fragile components in the cameras. During the summer these are fluctuations in electrical power caused by all of the air conditions and the switching going on by the power company. Since you cannot put line conditioners or surge protection on the cameras, they are fully open to this noise. It's either that or just the heat of the summer. Either way, the components in the cameras seem very weak and fragile. To have a 100% of my outdoor cameras fail within 14 months is disturbing.When the cameras work, they do an adequate job. Other than the hardware failures, I am pleased with the picture quality and the functioning of the cameras.I would be hesitant, however, to invest in this system again since it appears that the component quality is severely lacking. At least, that has been my experience.

The Logitech Wilife outdoor cameras have a known defect (caps melting).[...]They fail in about a year. This is due to the following four 1000uF caps: C26 C27 C31 C32. The initial was a10v cap then later releases were 16v. I replaced them with 25v. See Digikey part number UHE1E102MHD6. The caps are from Nichicon and are Aluminum Electrolytic. They are rated for 10,000 hours at 105 degrees C. The caps don't fit perfectly (the original are 8mm diameter versus 12.5mm that I put in) so insulate the leads and let them float above the circuit board.DLC-810e, CLC-110e, DLC810e, CLC110e, Lukwerks Outdoor Camera, 961-00290, Wilife Outdoor Camera, Logitech Outdoor Camera

Easy to setup and renders quality images. If somebody is fooling around your property and the camera catches him (outside OR inside)you have evidence. Plus it will send an email to you away from home so you can see what's going on .... a little pricey but great features. No monthly fee .... I like that.

I bought this product for my old Dell Dimension XPS-T450 to extend its usefulness. As I was unaware of that the maximum RAM for each slot was 256MB, the computer read as 256MB instead of 512MB. With the seller's outstanding assistance I successfully installed two replaced 256MB memories to get total 512MB, the system is now working fine and steadily. It is worth spending $28 to keep the old computer working as an experimental machine.

This is a good quality printer. HP makes better ones, but the price for this one is good. I have had no problems with it so far and have had it for and year and a half. The color cartriges are the problem. ... I heard the grey cable that goes into the back of the printer was getting recalled because of possible electrocution and shock hazard. It was made by Longwell electronics. Seems fine to me.

At first this printer worked well, but after a year it is nothing but trouble.To begin with, you can't print more than 4-5 pages before the &quot;page grabber&quot; will start to grab more than one sheet of paper at a time, and the text ends up going across both of them.Then there is the printer driver, which is also not up to par -- where is the manual two sided printing that has been in the classic Mac OS for all of these years?In short, this was my last HP printer. The jamming paper feed is too much for me to handle.

This thing works sometimes, and its cheep. Other then that I don't have much good too say about it. It uses up the ink in the expensive cartridges like water. And is so noisy it sounds like a truck going off road. I've owned quite a few cheep HP ink jet printers, and I've been disappointed by them all. I am going with Epson or paying a little more for a higher model HP. In the print world, you get what you pay for and buying cheep is a bad idea.

I bought this printer 3 years ago. It works great. The only problems are: the power cord has a short in it, the ink is pricy, not enough memory, freezes up, and sometimes will print lines or it will smear. I like HP printers and think I will stick with HP for a long time. I am going to up-grade to the HP laserjet 4050N or 1300N because of our home network. I think this model has some defects but in the newer printers HP has fixed them.

I've tried two Lexmark printers: Z51 and Z53. The Z51 was so-so and the Z53 was pretty good. However, both sucked ink faster than Dracula sucks blood.The P1000 prints incredible pictures without draining the cartridge as quickly as the Lexmarks did.IMHO, this is the best printer you can buy for the price. Cartridges are expensive but refill kits aren't...and the refilled cartridges print as well as the originals.You will NOT be disappointed!!

The printer is great. I couldn't be happier with it, especially since it is so inexpensive. The thing I don't like is the fact that the ink costs an arm and a leg -- check out the cost of HP cartridge 78...If you print many photos, the ink costs start to add up--mainly if you are doing full letter size prints. However, it's still much cheaper than getting film developed.

I've had this printer for about 8 months, and I am finally happy with it in general. When I first set it up, it was via parallel connection on a PC running Windows ME. Total set up time was 10 minutes and text and graphics printing was very good. However, loading photo paper, which requires some tricky maneuvers and varies among the different sized papers, is enough to discourage a lot of photo printing, especially on 4&quot; x 6&quot; paper, which uses a separate tray for loading and is finicky on a good day. I then moved the printer to my laptop and tried to set it up via the USB port. This was rougher and required uninstalling the printer and then reinstalling it and selecting USB connectivity. Not a big deal except nowhere does it say to do that; you just figure it out by trial-and-error. The big deal came when I upgraded my laptop's OS to Windows XP. The original driver for ME or even Windows 2000 does not work with XP. Finding the driver via the HP website was the run-around of a lifetime; their FTP site in the U.S. was so overloaded that you'd only be directed to that site at weird, off hours. Otherwise, you were redirected to the Twilight Zone. My success finally came when I located (via a Google search) HP's Euro FTP server, which at midnight here was quite responsive. Recently, the driver has been easier to access (I know, because I just had to reformat my C: drive). Print quality remains quite acceptable and the noise level is very good. Ink usage is a bit high, but as I rarely am in the mood to print photos anymore, it's less of an issue. Overall, this is a great all-around printer for the money.

I've had the P1000 for a couple of years. Worked great with WindowsME. After installing XP on my desktop I had to reinstall the printer software to get it to work. Just got a new laptop and it doesn't work at all.. in fact, the P1000 causes my Dell Inspiron to crash whenever I disconnect the USB cable. When the cable is connected the laptop never recognizes the printer.

The only things that has worked harder for me is my Maytag washer. Honest!I have printed perhaps 4oo to 5oo great photos in 8x10 and several hundred 4x6. I printed simple signs that earned more than the coast of the printer, all the ink used and paper. I am on my 3rd case of plane paper, plus heavy weight paper.I have use it with the usb cable and the printer cable. The small photo tray worked well after I surrendered and read and followed the instructions.I have had my P1000 for 5 years or more...I have gone through several PCs, am on my 3rd scanner and have tossed two printers in the dump...one a wide print photo oriendted HP, the other that came "free" with another PC.I considered buying a new one (or two) on Amazon 2 years ago for ?..$75/00 if a member correctly.I have been able to download software that enables we to use it on XP home edition. The HP software worked well for me. Also have been using photoshop 6.I have given away numbeous framed photos to frineds and family printed on it and had the pleasure of seeing people enjoy them.I doesn't give up. There many be better printers. I am still looking and also am holding on to this HP P1000...I also have a Canon i9900 which is working out well enough.And I just might get another P100.

If you are looking for a home photo-quality printer (not pro quality- but good enough form me), for a decent price. This is your printer.I can print 8X10's that come out with amazing results. I even use my scanner to print from the negatives and the photos print out better than my local store (I am not comparing to 1-hour development, I am comparing a local specialty store with an amazing reputation).Just make sure to use (and of course set the printer) to high quality photopaper, and you will see amazing results.I bought this printer a few years ago and have never had a problem with it. I don't know if the newer versions are better, but I can't say a bad word about this printer.

I really liked this printer when I first got it about 3 years ago. Sure it was loud and a little slow, but it printed pretty good. Well, after about 1 1/2 years of VERY light duty, I all of a sudden start getting error messages on my PC telling me the printer is not connected to the computer. First I changed the cord to no avail, then I tried different open USB ports on my computer, so it ends up I just have to position the USB cable perfectly to the back of the P1000 to get it to work. At least it would still work, right? Well that got me by for about six months and now it just will not connect at all. Now my HP P1000 has a nice new home in the trashcan and I'm giving Canon a try. If HP puts as much thought into printers as they do computers I definetely don't want to buy another HP product again...

I agree with all the positive comments on this workhorse of a printer. I have been using it since 1999 and haven't been able to find a replacement printer since, that is as reliable, user-friendly, functional, full-featured and perfect as this printer. I'm so upset that drivers for Windows 7 are not, nor are they apparently being considered for this printer. Shame! I have been able to use it on my Win7 system using "HP Deskjet 930C/932C/935C" drivers as some help forums have suggested but it is a compromise that removes some cool PhotoSmart features like the ink cartridge level information and other useful things. Too bad - altho I still haven't given up. I hate all the new printers that are out lately that have these elaborate CD install process that includes all kinds of junkware and extras that need to be installed on every device before simple prints are attempted. It didn't used to be this way.

The photosmart P1000 was one of the best printers ever made. The software is so easy to use. Setup is a snap. The templates are easy to find and use. Quality is great. Had several other printers since and I had to go back to this one. I purchased a printer at the beginning of the year that I saw on TV. Loud, not the word for it. No quality. Their Ink goes just as fast as any other ptinter. Wanted to enjoy printing with my printer.

The eMarker does what it is advertised to do on most stations (at least here in LA), even Radio Disney is available! However, the design of the device is lacking. You have a big hangtag on your keychain that does nothing but display upto 10 &quot;emarks&quot; or dots. It doesn't tell the time, it doesn't do anything but mark. The 10 marks is a bit limited (if I really get into it, I can easy do the 10 marks between times that I can get to a computer.) Also, if it is in your pocket, it is easy &quot;clicked&quot; so you get a bunch of the same emarks (No, I did not need to know that at 9:47pm my pocket wanted to know what that song was called.)If there is a next generation, it might be kewl. Right now, it is just a conversation piece.PS. I wish Sony would offer it for Palm OS (such as the Clie', Handspring and Palms) as linked software.

From the gadget guru to the techno dummie this gadget works for all. I use it all the time to bookmark songs on the radio...the only major problem I have with it, is the time in which it takes to update the website(in rural areas)...usually I have forgotten which station I was listen to, and find myself wading through the stations trying to remember which song I was listening to...but this is just logistcal stuff that I am sure Sony will work out. But overall the idea is great, just needs some tweaking.

B00004WIMW
Sony eMarker
I got one of the earliest examples of these new devices. They are simple to install and fairly simple to use. In essence, you put it on your keychain, and anytime you hear a song you like (and perhaps want to buy), you hit the button. Then, you attach it to your computer via the cradle, log on to Sony's eMarker website, and by selecting your city and station (you must remember what station you were listening to when you hit the button), it checks the time stored in the unit against the playlist supplied to the Sony website from each radio station. You can get some info on the song/artist, hear some clips, and if you're so-inclined, you can buy the complete song from Sony via download. This is a 'free service', unless you decide to buy the music. In that sense, the eMarker is a clever tool for Sony to sell direct-to-consumer, avoiding the other means of internet distribution now available, as well as circumventing the retailer.

i brought this gift with high hopes. Sadly, those hopes came crashing down pitifully. I admit that sony had a great idea. In fact, it would have been perfect for me because I'm always wondering who sang THAT song on the radio.It's cute and small, but not for a keychain. In addition, the USB capability is really handy (at least for newer computers). The product is a lot like its website--cute, stylish, but not practical. I disliked having the radio station settings so limited and the song information arriving so slowly.I would recommend holding off for a better product.

B00004WIMW

I have a terrible memory. Nearly every time I hear a good song on the radio, I am only left with a few catchy bars. That's why I love this thing. All you have do is push a button and BOOM! You're song is there! The website works nearly every time, and the format is very convienent. Before you buy it, though, you should check on the website (www.emarker.com) to see if your area is listed.

B00004WIMW

Save your money. It's pure hype. If you listen to more than one station, you have to wade through several audio clips to figure out which one you liked. If you listen to anything but pop, it's useless. It's just a gadget to get you to buy CD's through their web site.

B00004WIMW

The Sony eMarker is an awesome idea, but understand that it is nothing more than a stopwatch that depends on data from a website powered by Sony and Broadcast Data. This information seems to need some help, as the &quot;24 Hour&quot; wait for playlist updates is sometimes taking 5 days. The product is cool, but Sony needs to keep their end of the deal and update the website... I'd wait for a few months before buying another one so that Sony can iron out the bugs.

The Sony eMarker is truly an amazing product. The unit is very small and connects through USB. It does everything it advertises and is well designed. The only problem is that it can only hold 10 songs at a time and you have to know the radio station that you heard them on. Also the eMarker website that you must upload the songs to has way too much unnecessary Flash and is therefore slow and annoying. Overall it is a novel concept and I'm sure it will improve. Get one!

I've had many problems with Sony computer items before, but I thought I'd give this one a try. After being on the phone with Sony (who didn't even know what the emarker was) for over four hours, I still can't the thing to work. There's some problem with the program you download from emarker.com. The program has problems loading the emarker USB drive into your computer. Thus, you can't use it at all. If I were you, I'd wait till they develop this product further and work out all the problems. Sony told me they would pass my problem on to the Research and Development team, who would try to get back to me as soon as they can (I hope this team knows what the product is!)As for me, I plan on returning my emarker today.

I just got my Emarker in the mail and I am pretty impressed with the hardware. However, the driver support is terrible.

If you are interested in the drivers email moon@home.com and I will sent them over to you. I hope this helps someone out there that wants to play with this unit but Sony doesn't care about U!

B00004WIMW

Great idea or so I thought. I fell for the marketing hype. This little gadget is nothing more than a time stamp. You plug it in and it reads the time stamp and shows you what was playing on the radio station that you pre-selected when you registered on the web. If you were listening to a different station, you have to look it up on their site, which defeats the purpose of this thing. You can already look up songs on the net without this gadget. In fact, you can do it better without the gadget, because, emarker's coverage is limited (No AM, jazz, classical, or music videos). Save your money!

B00004WIMW
Sony eMarker
Before you buy this thing, understand one thing. When you mark a song, you have to remember the station you were listening to at that time. So if you have 10 emarks, you have to remember the station you were listening to at the time of each of the emarks. I wondered about this detail before I bought the thing and found no mention of it anywhere on their website. I assumed it would mark the station somehow. My mistake. Learn from it.

B00004WIMW

Once you get past the hype, you will realize this device is a ..clock. When you press the button on the e-marker, it only records the time, not the radio station. When you download the information to your computer and connect to the website it looks for the song that was played on the station how many hours/days ago you pressed the button. If you selected the wrong station you will get a different song.If you use the scan button on your radio, this product is not for you

eMarker has updated the drivers on their site. The product is now able to support Windows 95, 98, Me and 2000. I bought several as stocking stuffers for Christmas.

A new driver has been released at www.emarker.com The device does support both Windows ME and Windows 2000. he other reviews were written when this was not the case. I just recently purchased an emarker and it works wonderfully. The emarker web site could use a little improvement but other than that it's definately worth the 20 bucks . . . .

Great idea for a product, but needs some improvements, which may or may not happen. Great idea for those times you here a song you want to check out again.Giving it a lower rating because the software does not load on Windows 95 or Me machines. Also, no coverage for jazz or classical stations, as stated above, which would truly make this a remarkable product.

I bought this for my sister on christmas and it has been great! You just pick your favorite stations get in the car and when you hear a good song press the button. One of the only complaints is that you can't remember what station you were listening to. Usually you can look at the title and figure it out. For $20 it was a great investment, the software works, but the website seems kinda slow sometimes. I would reccomend this for anyone who listens to the radio.

I was sold this item only to learn, after opening the corresponding Web site necessary for eMarker function, that Sony was terminating the corresponding Web service in 45 days!!A great idea but no support.

I really enjoy my eMarker. You'll want to make sure that your favorite radio station(s) are cvered by checking on [website]. I won't go deep into the functionality, but it works great for me and it's the best conversation piece I've ever had. Everyone wants to know what the green surfboard looking thing is. For the price, it's a fun and functional little gadget.

I found this eMarker semi-helpful. It has some good points, andsome bad points as well. But I found that for [the price], it was worth the money.The eMarker only lets you select 3 stations from in your area, and one as a default station. Unfortunately the eMarker service doesn't include my favorite radio station, I still found it helpful at times.I found that the one button that it has can easily get pushed, and has a couple times in my pocket, but fortunately it has a delete option which you can use in case this happens.The best thing I think about the eMarker is the way it's a conversation starter. It's hard not to notice it with it's &quot;Slime Green&quot; casing with orange borders, which people always ask about.It's a neat little gadget, and if Sony adds a couple better functions to it, then I'm sure it'll become much more popular.

Please be aware that the Sony eMarker DOES work with the following operating systems: Windows 98SE(Second Edition), Windows Me(Millenium Edition), Windows 2000. Mac version will be offered soon. I am currently using the eMarker with WinME and it works great! Do not fooled by other reviews which state otherwise.

B00004WIMW

The eMarker is a wonderful and innovative idea. The size is right and the price is reasonable (a little cheaper would be nice, but its acceptable). The big problem stems from the fact that Sony has no Mac support... or support for a number of other platforms as well. It's not like its hard to make the eMarker compatible with these systems. Sony is only shooting themselves in the foot. If this product were to support the Mac, it would be a 4 or 5 star product.

Do not buy the emarker. It is being shut down by Sony on 9/30/2001. I received the following email from emarker.com on 9/5/2001:We will be permanently closing down the eMarker.com service on 9/30/01.To keep your eMarks information, just print the screens from your eMarks pages.For eMarker refund information, please click here.(emarker.com)Thanks for your support.The eMarker Team

Whenever I walk into music stores or log onto online CD stores, I can never remember what CDs I wanted to check out or to buy. Since it is while listening to the radio on my car that I have that &quot;I-gotta-check-this-song-out&quot; urge the most, this product's service, its small form factor and portability make all the sense to me. The only drawback that I can see is that eMarker does not cover jazz stations. Also, I would pay more for more advanced product from Sony that captures radio's frequency that I am listening to.

Sure, it probably does what it's supposed to do from a technical standpoint, but it's only going to cultivate more awareness of the music that we already hear too much about as it is. If you have tastes that go at all beyond the most commercial and mainstream in music, you'll most likely be disappointed to find out that very few small, independent, and/or college radio stations currently put their playlists on the e-Marker Web site. And knowing how operations and budgets work at these stations, it might be a while before you're able to e-Mark and research any tunes you wouldn't be able to get by flipping the channel and waiting 4 minutes. As an idea, the e-Marker is viable, but I'm still supplementing my car stereo with my pen, paper, and open ears.

I brought myself a emarker, which is just more than a glorified time stamp it sets up easly, works fine and is for me a usefull product, if you live in a big city like ny or la the site is updated every 10-15 minutes it seems that outside the big areas your SOL.. its a neat little gadget and good if you live in an area where its updated frequently.

This works like a dream to find out what song is playing on the radio. There are two problems I have, however. One is the hassle of hooking it up to your computer and waiting a day to find out what song it is. In cities with a large population, the songs get updated every 10 minutes. The other is the heavy flash use on the web site. This makes the process of finding out the song even longer. I do not have a high-speed connection, just a 56k modem. Even with these problems, the great function of this product makes it original and worth your money.

B00004WIMW
Sony eMarker
I'd classify this device as a toy for adults, not for everyday use. It looks cool and is fun to play with, but the use is somewhat limited. While it's good in the car, you'll have to remember the station the radio was set to. And if you're in a waiting room or other place that plays radio music, you probably won't know or remember the station it was when you get home. Also, there's often a delay of 24 hours in many areas before you can check what the station was playing.This device would have been much more useful if it was instead a feature of a handheld radio, because then it could automaticlly record the station.

I had some minor problems installing the software, I found it will not load on Windows ME. I also found I could manually install the drivers and it worked fine on ME. I installed it on my Win 98 computer without problem and everything worked ok. In my area the song database is only updated daily which is somewhat of an inconvenience. Overall a neat little product that would probably be best suited to the computer savvy.

I live in Phoenix, AZ and we have quite a few radio stations that are listed with E-marker. The main problem is that you have to wait 24 hours before the radio and song information is updated on E-marker's web page. Also, if you listen to more than one station it becomes a problem to remember what station you were listening to at the time you heard the song and pressed the E-marker. Trust me, it is hard to remember which one of your 3 listed radio stations you were listening to, especially if it was more than 24 hours ago - I thought the whole point behind this product was to let you not remember!

B00004WIMW
Sony eMarker
The set up is real easy, the site is too flashy (no pun intended) and the play lists are never updated. I have NO idea what the other people who give this good reviews are thinking. I live in NYC, media capital of the world, and if it doesn't work here with hip-hop and Latin stations, it won't work anywhere. If you r into Latin music the site tells you the stations are supported but when you mark a song it gives you the popular songs not necessarily the songs playing. It is very unreliable, I have yet to see it work more than 3 times, and I have owned it for well over a month. If you want to get it, DON'T. At least wait until they start working on getting the play list on point.

B00004WIMW

Do not believe any of the so-called good reviews! This product is nonsense and simply DOES NOT WORK. I was able to install it rather easily. However, the flashy sophisticated website is NEVER updated! The play list are NEVER available! I am very dissappointed in Sony. Great concept, good looking product as usual fom Sony. Typical lack of performance. My experience is 180 degrees from the good reviews and I don't believe they are real or honest.

This is a pretty good idea, but most people don't realize that it doesn't know what radio station you are listening to. You have to change that manually. Also, some radio stations are not listed. I put it in my car for a few days, but I haven't used it in a while. I think most people will end up doing that. They should give this thing out for free and support it through advertising, because it isn't worth [the money].

This was bought for me as a gift, but it is completely unneccesary. It's simply a case of a company using widely available technology to make some money off of peoples' ignorance... If I hear a song that I wonder &quot;...hmm, what was that?&quot; I simply log on to the StarCD website and choose the radio station I was listening to and the time. It uses the same data that this device does. The only thing this device does is record times. If you think its worth spending the money for a keychain timestamp-thingermajig, go ahead. Ill just jot it on my hand with a pen. (I have no commercial or otherwise affiliation with StarCD, I'm just an impressed user.)

I recently purchased the eMarker by Sony. It shows how far technology has come it also shows how useless some of afformentioned technology can be. It looks great attached to my keyring. Needless to say with it's sleek stylish good looks it attracts lots of attention. The main problem is its lack of extremely useful features. I hope Sony makes some revisions and releases a better more useful product like we have come to expect from them.

When I first heard about this I was elated, no more guessing what the song I was listen to is called. Then I connected to the website. At the time I had a 28K modem. Trying to access Sony's flash-enabled site was undesirable, if not impossible. I had to wait half an hour just to figure out what a three minute song was called. Also, the fact I still had to write down the station I was listening to. Doesn' that defeat the purpose of this toy?

This Sony eMarker is too easy and incredible for the person that can't remember a song name. Or your radion station never has a DJ to tell you what just played ! You just plug the Sony eMarker into a Palm style sync port and you have access to your favorite station's playlist at the time you clicked. And then you can hear a clip and buy the album online @ Amazon.com !

It's worth ... for the nice USB cradle which you can use with any device ( i use my mp3 player in it ).the device itself, and the service is pretty useless. It's often provided me with the wrong song, and don't count on it having the station you're listening to. the software you download really stinks and is way too flashy (it's always resident in the system tray)it's fun to bash it on a desk though, it has a very nice rubbery feel....

The Sony eMarker is a great product.You can bookmark a song from the radio into it. Its so small an compact that it fits on your keychain. It's also very light weight. weing just a pound, it's great to carry around. It quickly attaches to your computer through the USB port. You can even preview a cd and buy it online. The eMarker website will give you listings of the artist and song's name. You can even learn about the artist through the eMarker. All in all, the Sony eMarker is a great product, and I strongly suggest purchasing it.

hey.. the emarker is a pretty fantastic product with a marvelous and very resilient driver. The Installation is very painless on Windows 98 and Windows 2000 and the device works like a charm. minimal user interaction required.The site is also well designed , it is a little heavy in terms of flash usuage but if you have a broadband connection ( I Do ) then it is no problem at all...i recommend this product very strongly.

Duuude. This is sweet. I totally love it. I really lost the patience of waiting for DJs to tell me the songs, or to waste hours at the store trying to remember what I was looking for. This solves it for 20 bucks. What a bargain. It works great in LA. I listen to Krock (KROQ). It sometimes tells me the song before though, but not often. I would recommend it to everyone!

The eMarker is a great concept. You no longer have to rack your brain about who sings such-and-such a song. You just use your eMarker and check it later. That said, there are some problems:* The eMarker really only stores the time and date when you click it. I've found that if you click it at the very beginning of a song, it may say that you were listening to the previous song instead.* It has no idea what radio station you're listening to. If you listen to the same station all the time, no problem -- if you flip back and forth throughout the day, it can be a hassle since when you upload your eMarks later in the day, you have to try and remember what station you were listening to.* Their privacy policy is questionable. They don't offer a single, clear path for opting out of receiving marketing communications. You have to opt out _each time_ you provide them your email address or submit personal information. Instead, they should offer you a single, overriding opt-out option. Also, it's not clear on how they track what songe you listen to. (i.e. do they just track listening habits on an aggregate, anonymous basis or do they track it individually. If it's the latter, what do they do with that information?)All-in-all, a worthwhile product, especially considering the price tag. That said, there's definitely room for improvement.

I can't tell you how many times I've tried to remember a song after hearing it on the radio, sung it for the sales person at Tower Records, waited for the deejay to identify the song for hours on end (waiting in my car). SO GLAD SOMEONE THOUGHT OF THIS DEVICE, which tells me, the song, artist, and enables me to buy it right then online. About time...

This is new technology, what can we say? It might have its occasional bugs (not being able to get songs in a few days) but these are things that can be overlooked. Its new for crying out loud! The best way to get these bugs ironed out is by supporting the product and giving Sony feedback. The interface of this product is excellent and simple...a button and a tiny LCD screen. If you don't know how to use this then...technology isn't your buddy I guess. As far as coverage and the speed in which certain radio stations provide feedback is the sole responsiblity of that station for the most part (most stations take 24 hours to get a song. others might take maybe 10 minutes or so), and NPR support would be very much appreciated. Not every location on the surface of the earth is supported (yet) but as far as I'm concerned an e-mail request to Sony could help to do the trick. Overall, the product is great and it is a great Sony investment.

I too bought into the hype that the emarker presented, but after using it for a week I realized how pathetic this product is. Its nothing more than a clock that marks the time of day you here the song and NOTHING ELSE! You have to look up everything manually including the radio station and the appropriate time. Not only that but you have to memorize which mark stands for which station, it doesnt even do that!! How stupid, does sony believe they can just sell products by putting their name on it. Tsk Tsk. The product is also really dependent on the internet, so if you dont have a good connection like me you can forget the practicality of the emarker. Actually, even if you do have a cable or dsl line, its still useless.

I'm very happy with my eMarker! Those DJs play 10 songs in a row and they never tell you what the song is. It helps me a lot to create killer download lists. I live in Seattle and songs seem to be updated every few minutes.

its sony.. what else can i say =) alright, nm.. down to the review i first heard about the emarker from winmag.com (one of their newletters like winletter or something) .. it seemed pretty neat so i checked it out .. i placed an order right away and waited like a month because of a backorder.. anyways, while i was waiting, i discovered a similar device called the xenote (which just went out of business) its an interesting concept but i think sony overcharged for this lil device.. seeing how the xenote held like 4 or 5 times more songs and was free, i haveta wonder why sony made it 20$ .. however, sony decided to use usb which makes it so much more easier to operate. anyways, my system did have a problem with installign the driver because it didnt detect it and the intructions were minimal at best. however, my system is more unique seeing how it is custom built and has a satellite usb modem so i guess there is a conflict. on my other system, it was up and running easily.. its a nice device and easy to use and very fun =) even if the site is overly flashed, it still loads prettie quick on a 56k modem and is nothing for my satellite to handleanyways, to sum it up.. emarker is a great toy if you are a tru music lover and dunno the songs on the radio.. it does however take 10 minutes to update the site so if you want it quicker, like right after the song is played, and if you live in the bay area, another option could be www.buzzhits.com .. its free, and all u need to know is the time the song was played.. no dj.. nothing to buy.. but if you want something fun, a new keychain.. then go for the emarker.. i dont even use it that much. .but still =)

I have a Sony Emarker on a Win98SE platform and it works fine. I love how i can find out the name of songs that i had no clue what the songs name was.

I got this as a Christmas gift from my boyfriend. I am not so sure what all the bad reviews are about. All I know is that the E-marker worked perfectly for me and I use it all the time. I live in Boston and the songs are very accurate. Sometimes it takes them a day or so to figure out the song (reason for 1 less star) if the song is an 80's song.

I'm a gadget nut and this sounded like a great idea. Unfortunately, the execution of the idea was less than what I would have expected from Sony. Here's why the eMarker only gets one star:1. Windows 98 only. No Windows 2000/ME/95/Mac support. What were you thinking Sony? Why is it so difficult? USB support is there?2. Only a handful of &quot;big&quot; cities are available real-time. Even though I'm in the 7th biggest city in the country, I guess we don't count. The rest of the &quot;100+ cities&quot; require that you wait for 24 hours before you can get the song info.3. You can only store 10 songs at once. Considering the fact that I have to go home to use the thing (no Windows 98 at the office) and I have to wait 24 hours to get the 10 songs this is a horrible limitation. This device is doing nothing more than storing date and time stamps. Why limit it to 10? That's ridiculous.4. The website where you get the info is &quot;pretty&quot; but from a usability perspective it sure leaves a lot to be desired.Bottom line.... Wait until they get it right.

Don't let the sleek look of the emarker fool you, it's got bugs a-plenty and some serious design flaws. Here's what the other reviews (written by Sony employees?) and the literature don't say:* E-marker doesn't seem to work with AOL; you have to not only use another browser, but also set that browser as the default.* When you plug the emarker into your computer, it &quot;automatically&quot; loads your marks into the site...or at least that's what it's supposed to do. On 3 browsers and 2 different computers, I haven't quite gotten this to happen.* Sony seems to be more concerned about being cool than functional - to top off all the emarkers' inadequacies, they (over)designed a Flash interface to get your songs that doesn't quite work either. Simple HTML would have been fine, guys....Spare yourself the agony and wait for version 2.0....this is the first time I've been irate enough about something to write a review and I assure you everything above is true...

It's not perfect, but it's worth the money. I'm having fun with mine, and I've scored some songs I wouldn't have gotten otherwise. Pros: 1. Simple to operate hardware and software. There is only one button on the device. When you plug it into the USB port, it starts your web browser, logs you in to the Sony site, and uploads your time stamps. 2. All 6-7 local (K.C.) radio stations that I listen to are covered. Cons: 1. It takes too long for for radio station data to appear on the web site. They say 24 hours, but I've currently got stuff out there longer than that that I'm still waiting on. 2. Large device for a keychain. Considering the hardware is just a time/date stamp, it should be smaller. 3. The device only stores 10 songs, and there is no way to delete entries without uploading them on your computer. 4. Sony has gone through too much effort to make the website cool, and not enough effort in making it fast. It can take a little while to scroll through your local radio stations to find the song that you e-marked.

Where is the space for a zero star! Just purchased a emarker and ill tell you one thing, I should have read these reviews first. All the bad you hear about this little thing is true. I am not priveliged enough to live in an area Sony feels compelled to offer service in, so I dont even have one station to mark. The site is terrible and I cant even get the program to &quot;enable&quot; itself. Whats the difference though, cant do anything with it anyway. This is typical Sony. My advice, check out all the ratings here and go to the website and see if they even offer any stations in your area. Believe me, they wont tell you it will not work in your area. It, however, is a neat idea. Needs lots of work.

I bought the Sony E-Marker because I thought it was a great idea. I am the type of person who does not remember who sings what and the title of songs. I was estatic when I received it in the mail and could not wait to start using it. To my disappointment when I went to download the driver I found out that it is only compatiable to Windows 98. I am currently running Windows ME. I tried to contact emarker for support with no luck or response. I have no idea when an update will come out so basically I have a product that I would love to use just sitting on my desk taking up space.

I'm really happy with this eMarker thing. I mark songs with it almost everyday on WPLJ and I download the songs from Napster. I do have to wait for about 3-10 minutes (sometimes less) to get the song name, but I'm usually in the car so it is not really a problem. It would be great if they covered NPR. It works on my Windows 2000 PC at work and my Windows ME PC at home. The technology behind it seems to be pretty simple. I think the keychain product just remembers the time. It works flawlessly for my station, which is what is important anyway. The site is a bit slow, but it is a really slick design that is very interactive. I wish it held more songs than ten.

I can't believe how many people are complaining that they wasted $20, and now the product doesn't work at all. If you take any time at all to learn about the product, you'll discover it doesn't work everywhere! Before buying, just go to http://www.emarker.com/coverage/index.jhtml like I did. I found out it did work in my area, so I bought and loved this product, and I am amazed that other people couldn't figure out to do this themselves!So enough about how half the reviews are from senseless idiots who can't figure out how to do a simple check, this product is great. I listen to the radio for an hour or two a day, and this is indispensable. I used to jot down the lyrics to the song, try to find the song on Napster, download it to make sure I have the right one, then purchase the CD, possibly. Now, if I hear that great song, all I have to do it press the button - it's incredibly easy. Even if you just listen to the radio 15 minutes a day in the car, it's nice. You won't believe how many times you'll find yourself using it. But be sure to check the website first and save yourself the hassle that many of the other reviewers had to go through!

This cool little product has been just wonderful. I will never have to remember songs I hear on K-ROCK again!! I was delighted to find a song a few days ago that had been bothering me for months. I kept wondering who was singing it. E-marker found it for me. The website is incredibly cool too. Too bad you cannot experience it without buying it. You can actually drag and drop songs into categories that you can name. I am not a techie and I was able to get it to work just fine. The site is a bit slow to load but once it loads, it is actually very fast and interactive. It is a great tool for people who are really into music. I just love it!!!

The Sony eMarker is a GREAT new device, It collects a time stamp everytime you push the little 'e' and then you plug it into a Windows Based, USB system and the 'time stamps' are uploaded to your personal FREE website and you get to see who sung that catchy tune and what album it was (even links to listen to the song again as well as purchase the album). The device IS USB, so old Win95 systems won't be able to use it, but Since USB is so small it it a great use for the new technology! Unfortunatly, Sony's eMarker website only currently has the support for Win98, but they are developing it for WinME and Macs with USB.I have found myself using it All the time when the DJ doesn't say who sings the 'upcoming song', or if I really like it and might want to purchase the album.You will find it is a great conversation piece since Sony puts their own 'style' on it....'Slime' Green with Orange Accents, pretty hard to miss or ignore!The eMarker holds 10 songs or 'timestamps', but that is fine since you are pretty eager to find out who sung THAT song. When signing up at the eMarker website, you choose your three favorite radio channels, but you do have the option to choose another station in your area after you upload the 'eMark'.Sony has mentioned in their website (as well as the manual) that they will be adding the 'TV' function, so when watching 'MTV' or 'VH1' you will be able to use the eMarker for the same purpose.If you have a Win98 system and can never remember song titles or artists, this is for you! (Stay tuned for other Operating Systems.) But I LOVE the eMarker and would Highly reccommend it, it is VERY easy to use and yet helps out in such a small container (just a little longer than a Key, so it should fit on a keychain just fine).

Know this the web site for this gaget may tell you that the radio listings information is updated every 10 minutes. That was not the case with the radio stations I tried the emarker on. The only song information I could get was &quot;information unavaiable check back in 24 hours&quot;. They dont even promise to have the information in 24 hours. This is not the fault of emarker my understanding is most radio stations only update their play lists every 24 hours. So the problem is the misleading information provided by the emarker site. Caution if you buy this product dont expect timely information from emarker.

This Product is truly a great product. I found out about this a few days ago. This really is a great product, and it is easy to use, but this isn't really needed by anyone 13-24 because we regularly tune into the radio and/or watch MTV almost everyday. I could see this useful for older people, probably 40+, but it isn't really too practical for a younger generation.

For people like me it's hard to keep up with the different songs on the radio, and even more so the people that sing them. Napster is only good for some things, but if you dont even know where to direct your search then it's even harder. I love the e-marker...I dont have to worry about forgetting the music I love!

If you are lucky these days the DJ will tell you a little about the song you just heard on the radio. If you are REAL lucky you will remember what he said by the time you pull into the driveway. If you are even luckier, you will remember it the next time you are at the record store.What a great idea for those of us whose just arent that lucky.When I first got this thing I thought it was great AND I thought if anyone could pull it off it would be Sony. Well.... as with many other companies in this economy - rather than be creative and try a different approach, they quit. I just recently received an email from eMarker (Sony) claiming that they will be &quot;...permanently closing down the eMarker.com service&quot; even though they claim that it generated a &quot;...good deal of excitement&quot;. It used to be that companies tried a little harder at making something a success - willing to operate it at a loss for awhile until enough momentum builds to fuel success. I think Sony gave it a whopping 9 months or so to catch on... wow. My guess is that not many people purchased CDs from their eMarker website. But they never did try anything else to make it profitable - they just decided that the current business model for this thing didn't work so they quit.Until a month ago their site was HEAVY with Flash media. I have a cable modem and it was somewhat slow for me - I cant imagine what this would have been for 56k users! But they changed this - made it simpler/faster. And then they gave that a mere month. Nice execution guys... thanks for the disapointment!I really hope someone else picks up this idea, I am sure that with a little creativity it could be profitable.Anyway - dont buy it. You will only be getting back in line for the rebate.

E-marker started to lose it's appeal when I had a problem with the driver. Sony provided little assistance with the situation and I basically had to solve it through trial and error. The website was easy to manuever through, but receiving the proper listings wasn't constant. I will give Sony credit for coming up with the idea, and respect it's potential. However, for now it serves as a interesting eye candy piece for my key chain.

Sony just stole the idea from Xenote, iTag was far better and it was Free. iTag was working and has far more station, it was so simple to use that you just needed a single plug to work. They steal idea and they are not even abble to steal it correctly. It's just a shame for a such big companie as Sony.

I often listen to the radio and don't know what songs are called so I could download em. I saw an advertisement for this product, and decided to try it out. Everything went well until the first time I uploaded the emarks. For some reason 3 or 4 of each song was comming up. I deleted them, but was unable to delete the emarks on my emarker. I was very dissapointed in this product, espically the software and I strongly dissuade you from buying it.

B00004WIMW

I can tell you that I used to have a small smart device called the iTag from Xenote and that worked VERY well. Plus..........it was FREE!! I used to use it in the Bay Area and the selection of the radios was great, the Web site very easy to navigate on. I could even get my info in real time which was great. Unfortunately, this start-up, as many others, had to close doors for the lack of $.... Too bad that those guys at Sony have too much money but do not care enough about their customers to launch a decent product... After the PlayStation 2 fiasco launch, they keep going on...... :-(

Use of the eMarker depends on the eMarker website. However, Sony has just announced that they are discontinuing the website, and so eMarker devices will now be useless. Don't buy one unless you want a museum piece.For those of us that already own an eMarker, Sony has graciously offered to provide a cash refund for every eMarker returned directly to them.

This product works exactly as advertised. Click the button and find out what the song is. The website isn't set up very well, and it's slow because of all the annoying flash stuff, but with broadband it's definitely usable.Unfortunately, it's only usable for the rest of September. Emarker.com is shutting down, and that makes the eMarker useless. Thus, the 1-star review. Current users are being offered a refund, but my guess is if you buy one now you won't get that.I'd write more detail, but I have to go print hardcopies of my eMarks. :(

Once you get past the hype, you will realize this device is a [$] clock. When you press the button on the e-marker, it only records the time, not the radio station. When you download the information to your computer and connect to the website it looks for the song that was played on the station how many hours/days ago you pressed the button. If you selected the wrong station you will get a different song.If you use the scan button on your radio, this product is not for you

I bought this thing to get the names of songs on the New York spanish stations. I checked it, double checked it, called customer service, and STILL I got incorrect song information. Maybe its the radio stations fault, maybe its E-marker's fault, all I know is that it DOES NOT WORK.

It was most disapointing to learn that EMarker only services the top 10 major markets with 'instantaneous' song titles. The rest of USA will have to wait more than 24 hrs to get any information. The web site www.emarker.com is slow when working within your 'account' and the email support is poor with EMarker engaging in finger pointing blaming problems rather than addressing a resolution.I purchased 5 of these for presents this holiday season with expectations that this unit was a neat solution to hearing a song and wanting to know the title later when I got home. I did some research and my zip code was covered, the demo showed a hip session of information exchange. Only after searching for a reason to why my music didn't display did I learn the exclusion to non top 10 markets.Don't waste money, time etc waiting for EMarker to come up to scratch. This product is only for those in the top 10 US markets. However, if you're not one for instant gratification, and you like to wait more than 24 hrs for an answer to a web based music device then I guess you'll be ok.

This unit is quite difficult to use. The button is very sensitive, which sometimes causes false entries. The website is complicated to use. I think with a little work E-marker will be a good product to have.

How many times have I said to myself &quot;That song is great! What's it called? Who's it by?&quot; About a million times. The eMarker is extremely comvinient especially in the car. Most of the stations in my area provide the song info in 10 minutes, very few stations with 24 hour wait. Just perfect. :) The site I admit is slow and annoying. The use of Flash is a little too much, even a seperate, stand-alone eMarker app would be better. Other than that, this one's a buy! And for $20, that's great for a Sony product that provides such a great service.

I have a G4 Tower and Powerbook G4 and it works great! I love that I can just tap the eMarker and forget about worrying to write down the Song or Artist (great for the car!). The cradle is great too, but you really dont need it if you can get to a USB port on your keyboard (where I attach mine). Draw back is their website, too flashy. They need to tone it down, and make it less complicated, but it works! A+ to Sony's dev team!

I just got the emarker, and right away i love it. It is small, cute and it fits right into your USB port. You dont even need the cradle.The negative parts are that you have to remember which station you marked on if you listen to more than one station, but i dont so its not a preblem for me. Another problem is the space, but thats easy because you can just go online and upload them, and free up your space. One really cool thing about it is that you can mark songs from covered TV stations, or mark songs when you are out of town. Overall, its a really great and smart product and its really easy to use! I give it 5 stars because the cons aren't worth fretting over. I am a satisfied customer.

Great idea. Unforutunately, Sony pulled the plug on this service in 2001. This was a device that cleverly used time as the identifier for music that played on the radio. I wish my iPod had this feature. It was way ahead of its time.

It has the easiest set up in the world it took me no more than a minute to install the software. The emarker is easy to use and its worth the twenty bucks.

B00004WIMW

The idea behind this product is a great one, but the back up for the product is lacking quality. One of the greatest downfall of the product, is the inability to set which Radio Station you where listening to at the moment. I listen to about five different radio stations on my way to work, changing the stations constantly. It wouldn't be so bad looking through the list of what songs where playing on my preset stations if flash wasn't used. I think the use of flash is a bit of overkill. It kills the functionality of the device. Having to wait for its data to load. I think a simple page with great graphics and no animation would have been much better. If you got 20 bucks to burn, and want a cool gadget that grabs attention, get it. If you seriously want to use this often, with more than one radio station, I personally wouldn't get it. It's great though if you only listen to a couple of radio stations.

B00004WIMW

I think this is the best thing I got for $20 in a long time! It tells me all the songs I hear on the radio. Just click the button. That's it! I would highly recommend this to anyone who loves music and listens to a lot of radio. Lots of people in my school picked it up recently and it's becoming very popular too. The only set back is that I accidentally hit the button when it is in my pocket. I put some stickers over the button so it does not happen any more. Can you make it in more colors??

B00004WIMW

Well, I guess I'm lucky, but a) The eMarker was a simple breeze to set up, b) The drivers were 100% compatible, and when I pop it in the cradle, it uplaods my eMarks, and c) It looks really cool on my desk. My only wish is that it were a diffrent color, or were offered in diffrent flavors... Orange is all good, but I'd like to see a Black with Neon Green tints. It'd RoX0r muchly then. Then again, for 20 bux, I'm glad I bought 3 as gifts, the packaging is great, and looks very very professional, like some gadget that was more like 80 bucks, instead of 20... The only downside I have noticed is that the website to check it is really made with high-bandwidth users in mind. (In other words, you v.90ers are going to have fun waiting for it to load.) It's great otherwise, and on DSL, it's very very very slick. :)Responding to other users feed back: WinME compatiblities: They just released a WinME driver, go Dl it, it's 1.54MBs, and will only take a few minutes. Uninstall the device, then re-install it. Still having problems? :)Coverage: I've read some people saying that they bought it only to find they weren't covered. Read their front page, and *be sure* to check your zip (or that of gift getters) BEFORE you buy. I have no problem, I think there's 1 radio station here in Seattle that I listen to that isn't covered. (89.5, suggest this, Seattle eMarker People! Please! :)Cheers

Before buying this product I read all the reviews. Unfortunately, I didn't pay enough attention to the warnings that the product doesn't work. I thought I could trust a company like Sony to deliver a reliable product and figured that the poor reviews were the result of consumer error. I was wrong. The complementary reviews on this site just can't be real. The product looks nice but works like a piece of junk.

You do have to remember what station you were listening to but I usually only listen to three different stations and it's easy to switch between the stations on the web site. I also like the sound clip option that is available for many of the songs. If it's been a few days since I've heard the song and I'm not sure about the station I can listen to the sound clip and easily identify the song.I teach an indoor cycling class and have found this to be an invaluable tool for finding great songs!

Ignore all those bad reviews if you have some knowledge of the internet and computers. Yes, you do need to have patience to set it up. However once I got everything downloaded, I was in business. It is the coolest toy I ever got for [the price]. Maybe the reason I haven't had any problems with it is because I live in the NY Metro area. Do the marks sometimes take twice? Yeah, so you delete them. I have had none of the problems listed in the other reviews, mine works perfectly...and all my frieds cannot wait to get one too!

The Sony Emarker is a good idea, but it needs some flaws worked out first. But first, the Pros. 1.Long battery life 2.Again, it's a really good idea. 3.Very compact-fits in your pocket well.The Cons! 1.The keychain is low quality. It broke after 2 weeks. 2.You usually have to wait a day to find out what your song is. 3.The &quot;mark&quot; button is very easy to get pressed while in your pocket. 4.You have to lesten to 1 station. This is a lot worse than it sounds. 5.Sometimes, Sony won't have the song you want. 6.Only some of the songs have clips so you can recognize your song. Without this you can't know what song you marked. 7.There are many stations you can't choose to have as your station. Make sure to check this before you buy this. Goto www.emarker.com to check for coverage. 8.Major Problem! If you do not install the Emarker in the order the instructions say to, you will have some major problems!Overall....I think you should wait for a new and better model. Bye!Bradley

Samsung SCL700 Hi8 Camcorder with 2.5" LCD
Overall, I'd like to say that this camera is a beautiful and inexpensive camera with great features. I bought mine at [a physical store] becuase Amazon.com didn't have any in stock but it has 22x optical zoom, and 880 digital zoom which is amazing!! The main reason I bought this camera is beacuse I will be goin to Italy for this summer and also Tunisia and I needed a camcorder, (It is my first one). It has a PAL system built in which means that you can basically use it anywhere in the world. The visuals are great and it has digital effects such as, black and white, fade, black light, mirror, sepia, negative picture, art, mosaic, 16:9, and cinema. Maybe the only bad thing is that it doesn't have an image stabilizer but it doesn't really bother me beacuse the other Samsung that does costs about [much more]. I would reccomend getting a Camcorder bag and an extra Lithium-Ion battery if your going to use it alot. It has two features that one is, EASY which everything advanced is turned off, more for begginers, and then a CUSTOM setting where you can customize everything the way you want it. It comes with the AC Adapter and the cable, a Lithium-Ion battery, hand strap, shoulder strap, lens cover, and AV cables which work great! Another great thing about it is that it is very small and it has a light you can turn on that helps just as good as if you were in a pitch black room and you couldn't see and you turned on a flash light. I reccomend this camera to begginners and expirienced people. I LOVE this camera!!

We had used a decent quality camcorder before our son bought this one. This one has been a pleasant surprise. Although the picture quality might be more like 4 stars, the features that are provided at such a low cost make this a 5 star product. It has all the fundamentals for a beginner and it fits well in medium size and small size hands (unlike some that require two hands or very large hands or cost five times as much for a small form-factor). We had it out of the box in minutes and were recording first videos with it in less than 15 minutes. The price makes it affordable for school kids to have all kinds of fun projects with it.

review/text: ..... Anyway, took this camera .... on a Disney cruise and impressed by the ease of use, wicked optical zoom, and awesome battery life (used the camera for 4 days (even for playback to watch the 30minute tape twice) and still able to video tape with no recharge.The things I did not like about the camera are:1) placement of fade button, and fact that I have to hold the fade, then stop recording (old Minolta 8mm used to fade when I stopped recording if fade on). Fade button only accessible with screen open, so if taping using eyepiece in bright outdoor light, then have to open screen (shaking camera of course) to get to fade.2) Either have to display date on tape all the time, or not record it on tape at all. Old camera used to have auto date time option that displayed the date and time for about 5 seconds on first recording of the day, and wouldn't display it again until day changed. Not so with this as far as I can figure.3) Eyepiece view kind of small. Have to use this in really bright sun when you can't see the LCD screen.This is discontinued and you can get it now for $$$ if you can find it. I'm going to purchase the SCL-860 because it is same camera but newer version with image stabilization, photo mode, and remote control for $$$ ....

Samsung SCL700 Hi8 Camcorder with 2.5" LCD
Pretty cheap for a Hi8 camcorder, but quality is unacceptably poor. The zoom lever is hard to operate, and when you put in a tape the mechanism makes tons of noise, really making you nervous. LCD screen is a little flaky, deciding to quit working occasionally so you have to turn the machine off, wait 10 seconds and turn it back on. It also destroyed a new TDK Hi8 tape this past winter. I think I wasted my money, and look forward to getting a Sony this summer when I get a new job.

My Fiance bought me this camera for christmas and so far I love it. We couldn't pay the prices of the nice DV cameras and didn't want to go with a low-end DV camera. This is a great starter camera and I'm sure will last me until I have a better job and can afford a nice DV camera. The design is intuitive and the camera runs really quiet (that seems to be a problem w/ other cameras). I'd reccomend this camera to anyone who is getting into video. You can always get a video capture card for your PC and digitize your video anyway!! :)

I bought this new from sears in 2002 when my first child was born. Here we are three children later and still is are camera. Never have had a single problem with it other than the battery won't hold a charge much anymore but it's five years old. I even bought two new camcorders this year trying to update on technology I bought a Sony and a JVC hard drive model and they both went back the some day! This samsung took better indoor shots than both the sony and jvc combined! You think the new ones would have been better but the Samsung took way better inside shots. If samsung ever made a hard drive camcorder with the same recording quality lens as this one I would buy it again. This camera is probably hard to find nowadays but for the price you probably could get it at would really be worth it.

I'v had this camcorder for a long time. I believe my parents might have spent $250-$300 on it when it first came out. They got it for Christmas for me.. I might have been.. 14? (I'm 18 now) I'll tell you straight up that I never took care of it like I should have. We took it on vacation, I played around the house with it, videotaped my friends skateboarding, videotaped our shanigans and ran from adults with it in hand. I know I've dropped it, and most of the time it was kept on the floor of my bedroom. I still have it today, and it works just fine. Of coarse it's not the most high-tech digital peice of equiptment. In fact, this video camera is the only reason I still own my VCR. If you're looking for something not too expensive, easy to operate, and pretty durable in my opinion, this would be it. I read other reviews saying that other people had problems with parts breaking or certain things not working correctly, but my personal camcorder has never given me problems.

I wanted to record all the new things my 7 month old son is doing. I'm also broke. I need a good camcorder without spending a fortune. I looked into eBay and even used camcorders. When I read all the good reviews about this product, I thought I'll give it a shot.With the first use, our family fell in love with it. For the price, you can't beat this deal. The picture quality is a whole lot better than what I expected. This is my 4th Samsung purchase and everyone so far has been a very positive experience. I wish this camcorder has some "advanced features" like USB connectivity so that I can download movie clips to a computer. But then again, I didn't have the extra [money] to spend. In couple years, I plan to buy a digital camcorder but for now this will suffice.Bottom line:For 1st time buyers, this is a good start. It's not the best camcorder but definately a good one. It's worth the money.

I purchased this Cam for gift to a person in a PAL format country. There is no way of testing it in US. This is frustrating. However the Cam looks great except the USB port feature that I found missing but this is great for the money. For myself I have a Sony for 1000 bucks with digital camera. But if I just compare the Cam....Samsung has far more features for the price. Great camera...Hope it works great.

Samsung SCL700 Hi8 Camcorder with 2.5" LCD
This camera semed ok at first... but less than a month after I bought it, the eyepiece viewfinder broke and only displayed a white screen. In bright light (like outside) the entire screen is unfocused and a light object being filmed ends up looking like you filmed the sun, it does not filter the light very well. The battery lasts for about and hour and fifteen minutes when the viewfinder is open; this is not so great when you are out and about and cannot re-charge.This camcorder is the lower class model for Samsung, overall I thought it to be cheap and a waste of money. For only a few dollars more you could get a reliable Sony.The camera did have a few pros though, the mirror, negative, mosaic and art effects on the DSE button were fun, but not worth the hassle the camera gives overall. My advice: DON'T buy IT!

It was the right match for me for price-features balanced.I brough this to use it in India, the AC datapter can take in 230v/60hz and thats wonderful. The PAL feature is the one i was looking for. Its smal land compact and that makes this very handy. The Title feature provided , were you can select a title for your recodings from the list.Overall this was the best price i could get.May be two years from now, i m planning to dispose this and buy MiniDV which would cost much less than what it is now.so Untill then..SCL700 is all that i can envy about.

Like Korean cars, this Korean camcorder does what it says, but it's not something you'll be proud to own. The controls are awkward... even Sony's compact minidv camcorders have better buttons. The video quality is sub par, and my unit, which I received as a factory-sealed gift, broke after about 6 months, a first for all the Asian electronics I have owned. For a little bit more money, you can buy much better camcorders from Japanese manufacturers.

HP DeskJet 990Cse Printer
I bought this printer new, when it was HPs top of the line. I have been very disappointed in it from day one.The print quality is fine. The duplexer is a joke. It needs the bottom of the page to grip the paper, so it can not print on that area. The driver software gives you two options to deal with this - print everything at about 90% scale to squeeze the content into the printable space, or re-sort the pages allowing the SW to move the page breaks. Neither is appealing, so I found that I reverted to manual duplex mode - taking the paper out and reversing itself myself.The biggest problem I have with the printer is frequent paper jams. Even when using HP brand multipurpose paper, I find that the printer jams about 25% of the time. In the quest for speed, the paper load mechanism is just too fast, pulling in many sheets of paper instead of just one.

HP DeskJet 990Cse Printer
Over the years, I have used no other but only HPs for all my printing tasks and relied heavily on their "layered technology" printers. The 990cse is my latest printer and I must admit that the print results are as good as any HP printer should be -- the quality of prints (texts) are laser-sharp, graphics & pictures printed on plain paper documents are excellent and true-to-life, however, the biggest drawback about this particular model was indeed as we all know by now is the design mechanism. Occasionally, I would encounter a few paper jams here and there and can relate to most previous reviewers' about envelopes jamming up during printing and ready to feed out...indeed this is the most frustrating part. Due to the reason, the unit will not get 5 stars because of its design mechanics.PROS:Print quality (unbelievable laser-like texts -- on any paper type!!!)Rich colors and true black texts.Print speedInfrared link printing capabilityFull Duplex built in and removable (Automatic 2-sided printing)Duty cycle: 5,000 pgs/mo (does not make one difference to me)CONS:Very expensive unit ($400)Bulky designBad mechanical designNoisySways back and forth while operating (this is very common with HPs)Jams envelopes at most times & papers sometimesEXPENSIVE INK CARTRIDGES!!! (In the course of owning this printer, I have spent over $600 just on ink...and counting)!

After reading all of the bad reviews on here about this printer, I felt it necessary to voice my opinion, although I am not one to write reviews. I have had this printer since Dec. 2000 when it was top of the line from Dell. I have loved it and wouldn't trade it for the world. It does print slower, but I can always be guaranteed a perfect print everytime. I have printed many different size envelopes, papers and labels and all have come out perfect. I have not had to change the ink cartridges very often (I change about every 6 months) and I do alot of b/w copying. This printer is very easy to setup, use, calibrate, clean, monitor ink levels, etc. I have never had a problem.

I've used an HP DeskJet 990CSE as my main home office printer for over a year now. Print quality has been consistently good and I have no complaints. It doesn't print color transparencies particularly well, but I've never really expected it to, preferring, instead, to use a color laser for that stuff. I don't use the much-maligned duplexer. However, the single envelope feeder is extremely temperamental and jams frequently. I'd estimate that for every ten envelopes that I print, 3-4 jam, and some jams necessitate my opening the lid and prying the mangled envelope out. Other than the envelope path, I'm generally pleased with this printer.

I have had my HP Deskjet 990Cse since 1999. It is now going on 10 YEARS and is still printing as good as it did on day one! Yes, It does grab more paper than it should sometimes and jam once in a while, but show me another printer going on 10 years that you use EVERY DAY. I'll write another review in 2019!

This has to be the most horrible printer in the world. If I could give it -5 stars I would. I just got a new digital camera and of course just got this printer. Now when I print my photos it has blurred lines through it and is all messed up. Its print quality is horrible. It may be a bad printer - but HP is no help at all. They keep saying to install new drivers, when it is clearly a hardware problem. I want to throw this thing away, unfortunatly I got it on clearance and I'm stuck with it. Don't buy this pile of junk.

I bought this printer in hopes that it would be as good as myDesk Jet 540.It was not. My 540 lasted from 1993 to 1999.My 990cse lasted from 1999 to 2002. It was making funny noisesand started leaking ink from the cartridge holder (spray nozzle).Right now I own the HP 1200 Laser Jet. Get that one. Forget the 990cse.Note: HP1200, This is only if you want black-and-white.

A year and a half ago, I purchased everything I needed for my first computer. I did a lot of research and went way wrong with highly recommended Dell computer. But, based on what I could see at the store (the clerks at CompUSA are not too eager to help) I bought this printer. It has been the best purchase of my computing experience. Photos are flawless, as is everything else I print with this printer. It seeems to do what it is supposed to and musch more incredibly well.

I love my PhotoSmart 1215 but was a little discouraged when the driver for XP was not available. The neat thing about this printer is, if you mainly use it to print photos from a memory card, you don't have to be connected to your PC. Just know which numbers you want to print, enter and off it goes. The quality of my prints has been great. Right now it's connected to my iMac and is doing splendidly. It's quite dependable and not expensive. I'd recommend it highly.*****

This has been a great printer for me. I regularly print both 4x6 and letter size photos. The quality is outstanding, and the automatic paper sensor is a good feature. I had absolutely no problems with set up. The only improvement would be to print borderless.

I have had this printer for over a year and I still get compliments almost daily on the gorgeous pictures I can print on this machine!... I print fairly heavy quantities of pictures and have had the paper jam maybe once. This is definately worth the money. I have purchased 2 other printers since this one, trying to see if I could get better or quicker pictures. The other two printers have gone to the wayside (one is now attached to the kids computer). There was no comparison in speed or quality...the HP was by far better! It even produces awesome picts with remanufactured ink cartrides at a much lower cost. Overall...great printer!...

I have numerous printers available in my office for different functions. My Photosmart 1215/1218 gets all the work. It's fast, reliable, great quality and we have not had 1 minute of down time. Also, I purchased the auto-duplex unit that enables the printer to print 2 sided documents. Super easy to use and still very fast! The printer can be tricky to install, however when I upgraded to Windows XP, XP easily set it up for me. If you don't have XP, be sure to follow directions carefully. I was so pleased with the printer; I bought a second for my son to take to college.

I recieved this printer for Christmas and I have to tell you this is the best printer I have ever used!It took me longer to take it out of the box than it took to set it up. No joke. I find it to print slow but that is not a big deal with me. The print quality is amzing. I have to admit I was extremely skeptical when people told me that the picture quality was as good as pictures from a normal camera.Printers take up lot of think though. I must say the ink is not cheap. I don't print pictures that often becuase of the ink price. But honestly you could not tell the difference between something printed on this printer and a normal photo. The only possible upgrade I could think for this printer is borderless prints. It looks very cool too but it's a bit bulky. It is like a computer. It actually asks you questions while you print stuff. Don't pay 300.00 bucks for it. Buy it off Ebay.com. That is where my family got it. We payed 130.00 dollars for it and that it with shipping. Great deal. It was not refurbished either. It was brand new. Even came with a printer cable too. They have plenty left on there so go get one. One of the best computer purchases of my life. Setup was extremely easy! You can plug it in via printer cable or usb! It comes with the usb cord. I am using it via usb. When I plugged it in Windows XP automatically detected it asnd installed it. No software or anything! Guys buy it!You won't regret it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I have owned this printer for about a year. It has worked flawlessly printing all types of projects. It works great with my digital camera and works great with my visioneer 8700 scanner. HP was slow to update the drivers to be compatible with Windows XP but so was Visioneer. This printer far excceds the quality of the Epson printer it replaced. I wouldn't hesitate to buy another HP printer when the time comes.

I have a small business and it was important that the envelope feeder work well. From day 1, this has been a nightmare. Components of the printer block the envelopes/labels and they don't feed properly. If you use internet postage, you lose money with the misfed labels/envelopes. I'm very disappointed and am shopping for a new printer now, only a short time after purchasing this one.

I've had a HP842C for 3 years. On its last leg, I researched what printer (brands) to get, including all the HP's, and found the 1215 as the best buy. A friend told me the only thing good HP does is printers; don't know if that's true, but I am sold on their printers. I print mega digital photos, and the large ink cartridge is what sold me. I also publish a bi-monthly newsletter for my trade association, and my first copy from the 1215 was more than anticipated. I had forgotten what a good printer accomplished. The &quot;normal&quot; print selection produced text so crisp and clear; the color photos were superb. Print speed was quick - just watch out for the flying paper. The printer spits the paper out so quickly, some sheets landed on the floor. I've remedied that situation. Also had to buy a new 78 color, the print heads were dried up on the cartridge included in the box. Being an older model HP, I wasn't surprised nor angry. It's just one of those things. Overall, very satisfied. So much, I bought a second one!

This printer is wonderful. The print quality is exceptional, the speed is plenty fast enough and it was exceedingly easy to set up. I get excellent quality prints everytime. If I see a little smudge, I just tell the printer to clean the heads and my prints are once again perfect. We now have two that we purchased from Amazon, and I am trying hard to justify getting another one for my home. The employees that regularly use these printers are extremely satisfied. And the price is amazingly low.

I mostly use my printer to print out homework, but when i have a nice picture from my digital camera, i am very glad i bought this printer, seeing how i can just plug the card into the printer and it prints with increadible detail.I took a picture of a famous place in mexico and i had the same one in a travel book, printed it out on this printer, and it looked exactly like the one in the travel book.Scince i upgraded to windows xp, it was pain to update the drivers seeing how you have to download 3 files, but other then that this printer is great....if there is one thing to complain about it's the price, but if you can get over that, you can keep this printer for years. Mine is going on 3 this christmas i think.~hope this helps

This printer has been a nightmare. First I can not usemy Visioneer scanner. They say it is not compatable.I removed a jammed paper, and since then anything I print,such as invoices, checks and such, come out with blotchedprinting and paper tears. I get NO help from technicalsupport(They're learning). No 800 number, which means youhave to call CA on your buck.I used to swear by HP. Now I am convinced that theirproducts are close to junk.

I purchased the 1215 for two reasons: First I had a huge slide scanning job and wanted to print top quality results. The 1215 printed 4x6 prints easily and the results were spectacular! The 1215 exceed all my expectations. The second reason for getting this printer was that its hot I/O - meaning you can connect it to two computers simulaneaously via the parallel and USB cables. Not too many consumer level printers will do that.

The printer worked fine for about a year (no borderless prints though). After 15 months it started jamming every single time that I tried to print. I expected a ... repair bill (replace the roller) since the printer is out of warranty. According to HP, no 1215 printer can be repaired. Their only option is an exchange. They will send you a new HP 1215 for [price] (retail is [price]) and you return your old one. Apart from a ... coupon this is the ONLY option. Buyer beware.

Until this product, I was a huge promoter of HP printers, but the HP 1215 apparently was designed with little attention to Apple compatibility. Unpredictably it refused to print first in 0S9 and then in 0SX. I'm frankly sick of downloading and reloading new drivers only to find they don't work and/or freeze up my entire computer. Because of this printer I've cleaned off my entire hard drive, lost valuable files and programs, and still wound up with a non-functional machine. It's been in my closet for 6 months, and I'm considerably happier with a new bottom-of-the-line Canon printer.

I had had two HP printers. Both broke in the same places - where the paper shoots out from the printer; the wings or the "arms" which guide the paper from the printer - both broke easily.Also I get an annoying message on my computer that the "yellow box marked !" is on and therefore I have to exit out of the printer mode and reset the yellow box so that the ! is deleted. Then go back into the printer mode. This is so annoying that I am never getting an HP Printer again.If you look on the instruction book, the annoying message can never to resolved - only by resetting the message yellow ! again, and again!!!!!!!!

Every company has their specialty. Canon has cameras, Sony has audio &amp; video, and HP has the printer market nailed.Now, I will be honest, I have not yet actually bought one of these, but as soon as my next paycheck shows up, it will be mine.My father has an HP DeskJet 722C that he bought years ago. And even though it's only a 600 x 600 printer, it still makes great photos. That's why I told my neighbor when he asked me what to get that he should only look at HP. And he did, now he has a 932C that he loves.Now about this printer:The versatility between parallel and USB makes it easy for anyone with an older PC or newer PC/Mac to connect it up. (Hewlett-Packard's website doesn't say it works with WinXP, but read on...)Since I wasn't sure whether or not the printer would work with my notebook running Windows XP, I called the people at Best Buy and asked if I could hook up their demo printer to my PC to try it. They said sure, so I did. It worked flawlessy! I had a photo I had previously downloaded to my PC from a digital camera that I had taken of my cat. I opened Paint Shop Pro 7, changed the DPI from 72 to 600, which resized it to about 3 inches. I then blew it back up to 5 inches, which of course then loses quality.I set the printer to it's highest quality, and clicked &quot;OK&quot; to print. From the time I clicked &quot;OK&quot; to the time it finished printing was only about 30 seconds. Even on the cheapest paper Best Buy found under a pallet in there store, the image was still excellent. I am convinced and a &quot;true HP believer&quot; :).I normally wouldn't give something the highest rating, but HP has gotten me. I will have this printer, that is for sure.

I have had this printer for 13 years now! It has been fantastic! It finally died and I am now having a hard time finding a replacement.

HP DeskJet 940C Color Printer
I have had this copier for 2 years purchased used. Anyone skeptical of HP products due to bad experiences with one of their PAVILLION desktops (as I have) should still be able to conceed that they make durable and economical printers. Printer ink for any of these older HP printers is relatively inexpensive and the cartridges last longer than DELL's or Epson's. If you are doing typical office printing, I recommend setting the default to DRAFT mode which is more than adequate for inter-office memos and records. It is darker than draft settings on most other brands, which are often faint, uneven, or illegible. This setting can extend the use of full cartridges to over 1000 pages. The printing is pretty fast at this setting as well. You can decide if draft mode is of suitable quality for clients and outside correspondence. If you still need a scanner/fax go ahead and get one, but leave the daily printing to this little workhorse & you will save money.I have used these deskjet printers (832c up to 990c) and they dont break down or have error issues. I don't recommend inkjets for photograghs because the ink is not waterproof, but the few times I have printed with heavy ink the image has been crisp and clean. They dont require much disk space for software either.If dinosaurs had been this indestructable they might still be around today.

HP DeskJet 940C Color Printer
The HP940C inkjet printer is designed for the home or office. It comes in a light gray case shaped like other HP printers. It connects to a computer with either an IEEE 1284 parallel cable (DOS or Windows) or a USB cable (Windows 98, Me, 2000, XP). The black inkjet cartridge is the #15, the tricolor inkjet cartridge is the #78 (replacing the #17 tricolor cartridges used in earlier printers). This printer works well for the average user. HP has long been the leader in inkjet printing.The paper path is the same U-shaped method used in other HP printers. This minimizes desk space and provides a more compact printer than those that use an oblique paper path. You should connect the cable from the printer to the computer before you apply power to the computer or printer. The power supply is built into the printer and not separate like earlier products. This makes it more difficult to replace if it fails. It is not good practice to keep the printer powered on when not in use; heat is the enemy of electronics.The Quick Reference Guide has a section on pages 7 to 10 for solving installation problems. Be sure to read the warnings on page 69 about proper care of inkjet cartridges. Leaving them unused for many months may shorten their useful life. New cartridges have a plastic tape over the nozzles to prevent oxidation of the ink. Do not refill print cartridges, this can void the warranty.The Quick Help document has chapters on learning about this printer, printing on paper and other media, printer maintenance, problem solving, and specifications. There are five cartridge status lights to identify a problem. Both printer cartridges are required to operate even if one is empty. The Deskjet Toolbox provides functions like cleaning print cartridges. Print cartridges and the print cartridge cradle can be cleaned manually using distilled water and a clean cotton swab.

I've had this printer for almost three years and it's still kicking butt. It's probably the 5th printer I've had and all of the others (Canon, Epson, Lexmark and HP) fell apart within a year.I suspect the reason this printer has survived so long it that I bought an extended warranty on it with the expectation that it would soon find it's way to the dump with it's predecessors.

I bought this printer about 2 years ago. It's a great printer for what I paid, which was not bad at all.One thing I don't like about it, it's that a lot of times it shakes a lot when it's printing and when it finishes a page.Also, if by any chance you cancel a page that's printing, it may be a hassle to print again, as the printer may just print randomly any simbols it wants.I just bought a digital camera and it works great. I bought the most expensive HP paper, but I was not quite impressed with the results. There were pixels in the paper, and the colors were a little unacurate, especially the red. It made my hair look like if I had tinted it red, when I really have light brown hair.The speed is awesoime, as it prints fast on black and white.It's a good printer, don't get me wrong, but if you're looking to print pictures & detail graphics, look elsewhere. For just b&w; printing, it's perfect.

I purchased this printer with high expectations. But was very disappointed. Right off, I had problems with paper jamming and printer errors. I even think it jammed so much that a small piece broke off. When it prints the quality is great but I have had a lot of trouble with it when trying to print on card stock. It doesn't appear to be very sturdy and makes me very nervous every time I try to print more than a few sheets at a time. Even regular bond paper has a tendency to jam if printing more than a couple sheets at a time. I've always thought HP printers were the way to go, but after this one, I don't know if I'll buy another HP.

I have had this printer for about a year now. It's been working really well, and i have had NO problems with it so far. It has excellent quality photo printing, and it prints at a decent speed. It's not terribly fast, but i dont need a fast printer. I have the time to wait. I have read about paper jams that many other people have experienced, but my printer has shown no such problem. So in conclusion, this printer is a good printer to get. Excellent quality printer at a good price. A++

I've had no problems with it yet after about 7-8 months. It's pretty fast once it starts printing. It takes a few moments to start a print job though. I'm using the USB connection so it could be my USB controller that's slow, I don't know. I'd buy another HP printer in the future. I just hope HP can make the installation process simpler.Color prints on glossy are not bad but don't expect them to look exactly like real photographs. Either I bought the wrong model for "film camera quality" pictures or ink printers just aren't up to par yet. ...

We have had this printer about 3 weeks and the cartridge already needs replaced. We do not do an excessive amount of printing, so I think that is a little too soon to run out of ink.Also this printer jams up very easily (one of the reasons I was replacing the last HP printer I had) I feel I have spent as much time fixing paper jams as I have printing. It is easy to fix when it does jam up, but a little frustrating that it happens so often.The print quality is good (just make sure you have the paper settings set correctly to the type of paper you are using!) and it does print quietly and is easy to operate. But overall I would not recommend it.

I have owned an HP 940c now for about a year, and as it's now 4AM in the morning and I have a long project to work on, the printer has given me a hardware failure.Having said that I've tried it on different computers, with different cartridges (thought maybe the OS X driver was to blame but evidently not), and it's dead. Now it's 4AM and I've spent 2 hours troubleshooting the printer only to have it dead.To top it off this printer uses the HP #15 cartridge which is a #45 cartridge with half the ink at the same price.. you cannot use a #45 in this printer.I highly reccomend against buying this printer. Not only is it subject to the expensive ink cartridges but it has been widely known for paper feeder problems (a school district recalled theirs), and they are all eventually prone to this sort of failure.

I am a high school student, and go through about 2 reems of printer paper each week with all the homework I get. Needless to say, I need a printer that won't let me down. Well, the HP Deskjet 940C is what I use. It offers both great print quality and timely execution of tasks. I can choose from 3 different print quality settings (Draft, Normal, and Best), depending on what I'm printing. This has benefits in of itself. Moreover, it offers an outstanding 1200 dpi when using premium paper.Do yourself a favor if you're in the market for a new inkjet printer, and go with the HP Deskjet 940C.

I own a hp 722 that i used with windows 95. When I purchased a new xp computer I found that HP did not support that printer with new drivers.I purchased a new 940 that came with an xp installation disc and have been very happy with the printer, especially since hp extended their warranty to one year.

Lasted six months. Never worked exactly right since I purchased it. I think it had software driver problems. Would work sporadically, then lock up and paper have to be cleared manually. Final straw, no matter what type paper it was fed, it would catch in the feed path underneath the print head for no apparent reason. Of course the paper still keeps trying to feed, so the machine just wads it into a mess. In addition to the software driver problem, I think it has a significant design problem with the paper feed as it often trys to feed up to five or six sheets at once, even the HP desk jet paper designed for such printers. I will say that when it did work, it printed well.

My 940C lasted five years, but ate up its paper drive mechanism yesterday.The prints were very good, although color quality was sometimes off.Hard to complain when it came free with the Mac, but it is a slow printer and with amulti-color ink cartridge, somewhat more expensive than a printer using more individual cartridges.Always had minor paper feeding glitches.

What I like about the HP Deskjet 940c: Printed output looks terrific, and it&#8217;s fast (more detail below). It&#8217;s very quiet. It has a Cancel Printing button on the printer console that does indeed immediately abort the current printing job, a very nice feature. It has an ink level display that can be viewed onscreen in the HP software as well as ink level warning lights on the console. Envelopes are not wrinkled running through the printer (a problem with some older HPs). There is also a convenient single envelope slot for printing just one envelope without removing the regular-sized paper from the tray, for which the loading capacity is 150 sheets. In my experience, HP printheads need much less time- and ink-wasting maintenance and fussy handholding than the clog-prone printhead on the 1998 Epson inkjet I just replaced. I can&#8217;t tell yet how long the ink cartridges last; I&#8217;ll try to post an update when I have a better bead on that.What I don&#8217;t like about the HP Deskjet 940c: The manufacturer warranty is too short (only 90 days). The HP drivers install unusually slowly from the CD-ROM (8 minutes on my PC, where software for most printers installs in 2 or 3 minutes). Software uninstallation is also very slow and still leaves a lot of junk behind in the Windows Registry. Queue up four or more print jobs and you&#8217;re likely to experience a Windows print job lockup halfway through which requires ctrl-alt-deleting and reloading print jobs to recover, especially in the speedier Draft mode, with the current driver version. Envelope printing on a stack of up to 15 envelopes is prone to paper skips and jams within the printer in Draft mode; in Normal mode, a stack of envelopes feeds through much better. Documentation to show the user how to find or use useful features such as the onscreen ink level display, the Cancel Print button, and the single envelope slot is missing or confusing. I consider these defects minor, overall.Quality: Text in Draft mode appears a little dim but reasonably crisp to the naked eye (though a magnifying glass shows otherwise). I consider Draft mode good enough for all but critical applications, and of course, frequent use of it will reduce ink cartridge replacement costs. Normal mode looks outstanding even under a strong magnifying glass. I saw no advantage to using Best mode for text. A photo printed on photo paper in Best mode was indistinguishable from a photo printed by a camera shop. It&#8217;s easy and quick to change the default printing mode onscreen. Speed: Advertised printer speeds are always inflated, like monitor screen sizes and modem speeds. HP quotes &#8220;up to 12 pages per minute&#8221; for the 940c. Of course, speeds vary depending on setups. So how fast is the 940c, really? I connected it to USB (parallel port is likely slower) and ran tests printing pages of all black text with Word97 in Win98, with double-spaced 12 point font, on a PII-400 with 128k of RAM. I came up with average speeds of 8.75 ppm in Draft mode, 4.1 ppm in Normal mode, and 3.0 ppm in Best mode&#8230; very good speed for this price. Adding graphics, as usual, slows things down considerably, especially in Normal mode. A 4x6 photo, Best mode on photo paper, printed in under two minutes.The Deskjet 940c uses an HP#15 black ink cartridge, and either a low-capacity or high-capacity HP#78 tri-color cartridge. You can purchase accessories I haven&#8217;t tested from HP to allow automatic two-sided printing or networked printing. The 940c comes with a power cable, a black ink cartridge, and a low-capacity tri-color cartridge; you need to supply either a USB cable (with Win98 or higher) or an IEEE 1284-compliant (newer than 1997 or so) parallel cable to connect it to a PC.

I have owned this printer since Christmas ('01) and have had nothing but success with it. The print speed is great for text documents. I was also able to print great looking glossy slides for a poster presentation. The print cartridges seem to have a pretty good lifetime, as well. I haven't had any problems with paper jams. It has handled some documents with pretty hefty memory neeeds without locking-up too. Definitely, well worth the cost!

This is our 2nd HP printer. Only to say, we regret buying it. The 1st HP printer, was purchased over 3 yrs ago. It's an 1100c series color printer that is on a "higher" end of the printer line.Buying a G3 PowerBook had us looking for a USB compatible printer. At first, we purchased the LexMark Z55, which worked GREAT for almost year, before a faulty part went out. *(we do a LOT of printing).So, thinking about how a former HP product was great, we got this one at the store when we were in a rush. We didn't even look at the demo. BIG MISTAKE!1. SPEED, was the first disappointment - way too slow. LexMark speed is way better, even for photo quality pics. The ole 1100c is faster than this one too.2nd disappointment was HP changed the printer cartridges. These are NO LONGER refillable. They have metal clips on the sides, and there is no way to refill them.3. There aren't enough printing options available. Sometimes I wanted to makes changes that I could do easily with the older 1100c series printer. I found that the options change depending what program I am on, therefore making it more confusing. (to go into detail on this subject, I'd have to write a long long explanation). Basically, it was a LET -down, I don't even want to keep this thing. I'm better off buying a different printer, with refillable inks. Ink is just too EXPENSIVE to be purchasing and not refilling.4. When the Black ink starts running low. It Basically makes you change the cartridge. It doesn't allow you to run the printer on low black ink. The machine stops functioning, and the big ink light blinks, and sends a message to your computer, saying STOP! Color inks run low, and the computer allows you to function with low color, but different story on the black ink.

The HP Deskjet is an oustanding printer for the money! I've shopped for weeks checking reviews comparing printing qaulity and price. I could not find a better quality photo printer in it's price range! Compare Prices and quality output at any store and you will find the same for yourself! Contrary to other feedback here, I have had no trouble at all with paper jams. There ofcourse is a drawback to this printer and for this reason only did it not recieve five stars from me, it takes 3 to 5 minutes to print a 2400X1200 dpi photo. For the price you can't beat it!!

After returning two malfunctioning HP960c printers due to frequent paper jams, we bought the HP940 hoping it would work better. It was worse. The paper jammed or was shredded every second page. It took a great deal of time to print even one document. We tried the more expensive HP paper and the paper jams continued at the same rate. We were unable to print any envelopes at all due to repeated jamming. It is clear that the paper feeding mechanism is defective in these HP printers.We've had HP printers for years with no problems. We were loyal HP fans; however, we've had to return THREE of their printers in the past few weeks. That's unacceptable. We just returned the HP 940 and bought a Canon S630. So far, no problems with the Canon--a relief!

Despite the great rating and rave reviews, I curse the day I brought this one home. I have gone through at least a ream of paper in the three weeks I have had this printer--not because I am so productive, but because the paper jams so often and the printer actually shreds the paper as it tries to eject. Several cries for help and complaints to HP customer service resulted in &quot;that's a common problem. The arm doesn't detract after each page. You will have to manually reset the arm whenever that happens.&quot; So far, that means 6-8 times per day. No more HP for me! This is my second bad experience. You would think I would have learned by now.

Having previously owned an Epson 780 (wow, what a loud printer) I decided to go back to HP and I was not dissapointed. Photo print quality (at 2400x1200) is wonderful -- bright, accurate colors with excellent shadow detail. HP's print driver software allows you to edit colors and levels but this is best done in Photoshop or other photo editing software. Also, it's very quiet (a consideration when you're the only one up late printing). I have had no paper misfeeds as I did in older HP printers -- even thick photo stock fed well.Setup was a breeze. Installed the USB software, plugged in the printer, and away I went. All in Windows XP.The printer does use a good deal of ink and HP ink is not cheap, hence the four stars instead of five.

I decided to get a new printer for picture reproduction and small business projects. The printer shredded 40% of the print jobs I sent. The roller jams the paper in back, forcing you to remove a panel and ripping the sheet from the teeth of this monster. It is like playing toy-tug with my dog. If it does not eat your print jobs, then the sheet is fed in cockeyed and it prints off kilter when a lucky sheet makes it out of this beast. I was very dissapointed after only one week of ownership

I've had the 940c for a couple of years and use it at my work. I print 20 to 30 documents a day, mostly b&w; but some color also.Overall this is a good printer and does its job nicely. What this printer lacks in features it makes up for in ease of use and consistency. Rarely have I ever had a paper jam but when I have it's easy to resolve.

This is a great printer for any use up to 8X10 photo production. The "But" in the review is the cost of ink and the fact that it uses a single cartridge. I run out of one color ink even with it set to a lighter setting in the printing menu and I am out of luck. The rest is wasted. The two sided printing is great ...particuclary with all these programs now having the 'manual' on the CD to print....

I got this after my OLD hp printer finally died. The quality is good, but it is extremely slow. Took 2 hours to print a screenshot from Unreal 2 at best quality. Its possibly because I'm using the parallel port, not the USB. As the printer DID NOT come with a USB cable. Also, NEVER USE THE CANCEL BUTTON ON IT!!!! It sends a strange message to the comp. which the computer sends back to the printer and tells it to print from 20-80 pages of JIBBERISH. Also it is a MEMORY HOG ON YOUR PC!!! I HAD TO FIND SOMETHING ELSE TO DO FOR 2 HOURS!! But i must admit, the quality is excellent. On the included sample of photo quality paper, it looks fantastic.So if you buy this printer, buy a USB cable and have a lot of memory. Also if you set it to the max resoultion for printing, it requires 400 mb. of extra hard drive space.So the choice is yours. If you buy it and don't like it, don't say i didn't warn you...

printing anything on photo paper requires me to take all paper out of the tray and physically push a single piece of photo paper so the printer can grab a hold of it. Otherwise, it can't grab it. I can't be alone on this, and I don't know if any printer out there could really do it without grabbing two pieces because they tend to stick together, or not being able to grab it at all (as is the case most of the time). I recently switched to the 960c from a 970cse that burned out after 3 yrs, and they both suffer from the same problem. It's livable though, especially for the value. Other than that, it prints like a dream. Pictures look great for computer quality.

I bought this printer two weeks ago and had it up and running within minutes of unpacking. When I first bought this PC I feared the two most commonly documented problems,paper jams and printer driver problems/OS problems, but to date I have not experienced either and the quality is as good as the laser printers I use in the office. The only thing I dislike about this printer is the high cost of replacement cartridges so I am hoping someone will deveolpe a refill kit similiar to the one I used with my old Canon BJC 250, which worked great...

I had a very hard time trying to find a printer that I could afford that printed good quality images. I had an Epson 440 printer that wasn't very good with printing photos and it always put streaks of black ink on everything. I went to Staples to buy a new printer after my Epson died on me and was planning on buying the Canon S600 but they were out of stock so I picked up the HP deskjet 940c and was a bit worried after reading the reviews here that I might not have a good printer but so far this printer is great! The first thing I printed on it was an old photo of my grandfather that came out better than the original. I then printed some wallet size pictures of my son from his school picture they also came out wonderful. I am very pleased with this printer. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it seems to be a bit slow in printing but as long as the printing comes out well that doesn't bother me too much. I would definitely recommend this printer.

After 4 years of heavy use, our trusty b&w; HP laser printer died and we decided to go for a color printer. Since we recently got a digital camera, photo quality was a must. After much research, we considered buying a Canon, but went to a store to see if we could get any info about photo printing in general. A young man advised us to go for an HP, showing us pictures he'd taken and printed, and explaining some other points. We did some further research and the main complaint against the 940c was its' tendency to eat paper.We've had this printer for 3 weeks, and it did eat paper and printed unevenly until we discovered that a small door on the back, used to clear paper jams, was not fully closed. Going to HP's website, we learned that the paper guides must be snug and that it works best with stacks of photo paper, rather than 1-2 sheets of photo paper placed on a previous stack of plain paper. We have not had problems with paper feeds since.Overall, this printer is a fantastic value and provides the best bang for the buck you can get. The photo quality is indistinguishable from a 'real' photo. This, however, is dependent on the quality of the photo, as well as the paper used (we have had excellent results with HP's Premium Glossy paper). If the focus of the picture is slightly off, the print will look awful. The photos will look only as good as the original pictures. The plain paper text printing is surprisingly good as well, even in draft mode. Also, the print heads are part of the ink cartridges. This means that they are replaced when you replace cartridges and require no cleaning and less maintenance. As we've discoverd, replacing print heads can be expensive.Pros:* True photo quality* Excellent plain paper text printing* Non-photo printing is fast* Separate color & black ink cartridges* Printing heads are part of ink cartridgesCons:* Photo printing is not that fast, but the quality is worth it* A little bulky, but all inkjets are like that*UPDATE April 2003*Amazing - it still works like new! However, we we have covered our printer since day one as we have cats and wanted to keep the printer cat hair-free. This has also kept our printer dust-free, and we think it has made a difference. This printer has easily been amongst the best buys we have ever made.

My 940c stopped working completely 3 days after it was installed. Apparently, the power supply went bad. It could get no power. After spending a half an hour on the phone (my dime-long distance -- HP does not provide a toll free service number) waiting to speak with a technician, I was told the first thing they'd have to do was to send me a new power cord! Even though that clearly was not the problem, I had to wait 2 weeks while they shipped me a power cord (that turned out now to solve the problem). Then, they decided to send me a new (?) unit. It arrived today. The only thing that came in the box was the printer. No print cartridges. You see, they expected me to remove the print cartridges from the original printer and place them into the new unit. That wasn't possible since they were locked into place underneath part of the printer housing and the original technician was told that this was the case. I just finished another call (on my dime, again) to HP and was told that they could ship me another set of cartridges that would arrive in 10 to 14 business days. Hooray!! It has been eight weeks since I purchased this dog of a printer and I still can't print! Now it is my job to pack up the old printer and find a FedEx drop off site so that they can get their old printer back!

The initial setup was, as I expected, a pain in the butt. Someone needs to make printers and cameras as user friendly as other peripherals. I couldn't use the USB port because it just didn't work. My printer is hooked up through a serial port.When I first started using it the quality was great. The text and pictures looked very nice and the prints came out pretty fast when I didn't have the quality turned way up. The printer came with some glossy pages and I got some really nice prints out of it.Eventually (maybe 3 months later) my printer goes haywire and starts to print garbage. After restarting the printer and my computer several times it stopped. However, I eventually came to find out that my printer wouldn't print pictures anymore. What?!? I don't see how it can print text perfectly fine, but any kind of picture or shape does not show up. I've tried printing with the highest quality, changing ink cartridges, reinstalling, and upgrading but pictures always come out faint at best. It can become very annoying not being able to print out maps, diagrams, certain PDFs, slides, and other picture containing documents.For the most part I don't need to print pictures that often (thank God for the school printers) but it's just ridiculous that some kind of software malfunction has disabled that feature. I gave it three stars because the text looks nice and the printing is fast.

This printer lasted more then 2 years. Perfect prtints, and not a ink hog. But we bought cheaper ink and it caused the ink to drip or drag from the paper to the rollers of the printer. So if you do buy, make sure you only use HP ink. Dont listen to the sales guy at Frys like we did!!!!!

Hewlett-Packard's 940C is one step up from the 920C and there is not much difference. It's a good quality all-purpose printer that will print out clear text and pictures (on the correct type of photography paper). Its bare bones for printers. It is not the fastest, but are you really in a big rush? The good features are that it is fairly compact; the dpi is 600, which is the minimum you want and it works fine. It has all the features to print on labels, envelopes, stickers, etc. Simple one-touch buttons are great. This really is a great home printer and is very, very inexpensive. Now the clincher is that the inkjets are NOT cheap. However, I have had the "warning" come up on my printer stating that my inkjet will soon run out and it stays that way for a very long time. I have one handy, but I let the ink run ALL the way out. Hewlett-Packard makes good equipment. If I had the money and need, I'd spend $300 and get the HP Officejet Pro L7780 Color All-in-One Printer/Fax/Scanner.

This printer came as part of a computer package I ordered from Dell back in 2001 so actually it was free. I hated to let go entirely as the newer models since haven't been as consistent and easy to use. To keep it within reach in case of emergency, my kids currently use it now that I've upgraded to a 4 in 1 AIO printer. The 940 was easy on the ink carts and printing was fast and of great quality. Sometimes I miss the simple, classic things of my past and this is one of them!I never had paper jams and the desktop printer assistant was easy to use. It came with PC and MAC installation disks and pretty much installed itself!UPDATE AS OF DECEMBER 2005: Apparently the power cords in some of these have been recalled; mine was one of them even though I've never had a problem. I called HP and they sent a new cord within 5 working days! March 2006: Printer's still going strong 5 years down the road!

I've had this printer for a year, printed hundreds of cards, photos, orindary pages, etc. It's really a top-notch printer. Not completely perfect, mind you (I had one jam), but as near as you could dream of. I've also owned two different Epson printers, and one low-end Lexmark and found the quality of this one significantly superior. We're talking superb output, solid construction, good paper management. And economical. I swear I must have printed over 100 pages while the color cartidge was on a low ink level. I like it so much I'm going to buy a 2nd one for my other computer.

I have had the 940 C for close to 8 years, it got me thru Graphic design school and at home projects. It saved my life. I used it with an older mac and a new PC and had no problems with it. I think most hardware errors are user error and unless the printer was damaged internally you should have no problem with it. I loved this thing.

My 940c printer works fine and is quiet, but I was very disappointed to discover that the 2-sided printing feature is not automatic. The odd-numbered pages are printed first and then you have to manually flip the paper over to print the remaining pages. YOU CAN DO THIS WITH ANY PRINTER! Printing on both sides of a page is a very handy, paper-saving feature, but don't be fooled into thinking that the 940c, as it comes in the box, can do this automatically. You must purchase a separate &quot;optional accessory&quot;.

Apparently a replacement for the terrific 932c printer, this "upgraded" model is a bomb. Jams, can't print straight, picks up multiple sheets, and horrible service all add up to a misfire. I went through the hassle of getting two replacement units shipped to me, and both replacements had more problems than the original! I've written off my 940c. I don't think anyone should waste their time (and certainly not their money) on this one.

Had this over 10 years!! It is the best overall printer I've owned as far as durability/quality. The printer is too expensive now days even used. I paid $150 for this new 10 years ago. You can buy a cheap printer now days for less than $60!! OEM cartridges way too expensive for this printer. Only buy OEM cartrides, refilled ink quality BITES. I always buy expired cartridges now and that saves a lot of money. Great print(documents),not laser quality, but it did an above average job. Just bought another printer the other day for $20 and the documents printing is sharper than this printer. This printer rarely jams and if it does jam it is very easy to unjam. Envelopes jam more often. I dislike the ink low warning, it comes way too soon. In reality you have weeks of more printing. I usually wait until the printer will not print anymore, what a scam the low ink indicator!! I really do enjoy this printer especially now that I figured out expired ink works just as well and saves me tons of money. Picture detail is great, but falls short of professional quality even with the HP Premium Plus paper. The glossiness is good but is not even and it will smear. Needs to dry several seconds before touching. The worst thing I can't stand about this printer is, it doesn't have an automatic shutoff feature. This is the first printer I've owned without that feature, I can't begin to tell you how many times this printer has been left on.

I have had this printer since 2001 so for 10 years it has been working and has never given me a problem! Here's the amazing part: I am a teacher and I use this in my classroom. I print at least 500 pages a week on this during the school year, which totals to about 20,000 prints a year. 20,000 prints times 10 years is about 200,000 prints this little printer completed in its lifetime. The refill cartridges are very cheap on Amazon (hp 15) as well: sometimes as low as less than $2! It costs less to print pages on this printer than to use the copy machine at school. If you can get one of these cheap, it will cost you less in the long run if you only need a black and white printer. I know it does print color, but I do not use the color at all so I do not know how good the quality is or how long the ink lasts. The black and white refills prints about 1000-2000 pages before I have to refill it.Performance Plus Remanufactured HP15 Black Inkjet Cartridge (C6615DN #15)

This is the 3rd HP printer I have owned and it has broken the fastest. My first one was around for four years of college, then it died. The second, an 820 Cse lasted about 18 months. The 940c lasted me just over a year and died. Add to this the fact that the cartridges are expensive (I'm stuck with 6 of them) and don't last terribly long.I'm thinking laser to replace this one, and a Canon inkjet for color printing.

My HP Deskjet 500 worked for more than seven years before I finally traded up for a color printer - the 940c. I've had the 940c for just over 1 year and it has broken. I'm buying a Canon this time and keeping my fingers crossed for better quality.

I have owned this printer for about a year ... purchased it for printing photos and was impressed with the quality. However, like one of the other reviewers, mine jams again &amp; again. It feeds multiple pieces of paper and is just a pain in the ***. At $1/sheet for photo paper, jams are expensive and the ink just pools while it is jammed. It is a mess and a waste of ink and therefore $$$$. HP has been NO help as their warranty/technical support is for something ridiculous .. 3 months? Anyway, I've now purchased 2 printers in the last week, both are not as good in quality of photos .. they deliver a pinkish cast (Epson Stylus CX3200 &amp; HP1200 (I think) ). I will try a Canon next I believe ...

After using this printer for one year (home use), a plastic bracket to which a spring attaches to maintain belt tension on the print cartridge carriage broke. Rather than try to get a new part, I'm going to throw this printer away and buy a new one.

I have had mine for about two years. I love the color it gives but it has also given me a lot of problems. Something has gone wrong with the memory inside making it impossible to print in &quot;best&quot; quality. An error message will pop up on my screen and then it will start printing out garbled junk. I've down loaded the latest driver--more than once--but with no success. It has been a waste of money to me--especially when ink cartridges are so high for it!!

Do not buy this printer. I have had nothing but trouble with it- it jams every other time I print, and most of the time, it grabs 3-4 papers at once, and prints on all of them. I certainly expected better quality from HP, and this did not deliver. The printing is decent when it works, which is not often. I will be looking for a different company next time.

The printer does deliver a nice quality picture and was easy to install. Its major disappointment is the cost of ink cartridges and the rate at which it uses ink. (Even when printing in gray scale). I now know to more thoroughly research the next printer I purchase for its long term efficiency and costs of ink. As far as usage goes the printer has worked well for over a year without any problems or crazy complications.

I hate this printer! It is nothing but problems. Every single time I go to print even a single page, there is some sort of problem! The paper jams, I get timeout errors, the ink runs out too fast and I am unable to fill it with the refill kits. The thing has a mind of it's own and starts spewing out pages even when I'm not trying to print anything. It wouldn't be so bad if it didn't put trash on each page wasting my paper. It's a piece of junk! 1 Star is highly overrating this product!

STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRINTER, I have had a Hp 1100 and had moderate success with it, after a few months the multiple paper pickup and jam problem kept occuring with no satisfactory fix, I just got this printer and it is even worse, it does not print correctly and multiple jams even after two hours out of the box, the copy was consistantly misaligned. I am sending it back.

I replaced an EPSON about 6 months ago that worked for about 9 months before the paperfeed went out. I thought I was &quot;movin' up&quot; by purchasing an HP, well, this one stopped working after 6 months: the printer carriage gets hung up on the right. I went to the website for troubleshooting options, none of which solved the problem....and the warranty is the biggest weakness...90-days! This alone speaks poorly of the expectations HP has of its own products. EPSON's warranty was 1 YEAR, but I had misplaced the receipt. SO, perhaps EPSON is a better deal, as long as you KEEP THE RECEIPT!

The Hewlett Packard 940C is one of the best PHOTO QUALITY Printers on the market. It uses the exact same color and black and white cartridges as the more expensive photo quality printers, therefore a higher model is only for luxury not quality. The speed of pages per minute is excellent, as is the color quality. In price it has over time completely held its value.

The HP 940C gets the job done. Its horizontal paper feed means few if any paper jams. The two cartridges it comes with will work for many, many copies especially if you chosean economy setting for your printing jobs.This baby works flawlessly with my Power Mac G3.

I bought this printer about a month ago and was slightly disappointed by its performance. The print quality is great, the photos I printed looked 99% like the 35mm prints that came from the lab, but I made the mistake of using 4x6 photo paper instead of the standard 8 1/2 x 11 sheets. Approximately every-other print came out crooked on the paper, and the printer has an annoying habit of cutting off the last inch of the image because of margin restrictions. I couldn't find an option to use the maximum paper margins, and so had to end up making a white border around the image so that the printout didn't look strange.I bought this printer as a replacement for a 5-year-old Epson brand, and am considering going back to it because of my frustrations with this HP. Summary: Great print quality and speed, but not good with custom paper sizes.

I bought this printer based on the reputation of HP--not again. I have had it for 5 months and it just stopped working. I went to the web site to get troubleshooting info about the error codes. I have spent an easy 6 hrs working on it and nothing worked. It suggests calling phone support "if you are still having trouble." I called phone support but, because I had bought the printer more than 90 days ago, they wanted [money]per phone call--forget that. I email for support and it sent me a computer generated response redirecting me to the same web page I first started with. I am taking the [money] I would have wasted on the phone call just to get someone to read me the same damn web page and then ask me to phone back later and going to try a new brand of printer. HP no longer means quality!!!

I've had the HP940c for a year now with no problems. The printer installed via USB under Windows XP without a hitch. Photos and text are good quality. I have used multiple pages/page printing and manual duplexing without any hicups. No jams to date. Replacement of catridges is easy. Low cartrides are noted by a dialog box popping up and by lifting the lid to the catridges to see where the cartridges line up with the icons inside the printer. Replacement catridges are expensive, but this printer scored well vs other inkjets in cost/page on PC Magazine's review. I use a HP Laserjet 1200 for volume printing where color is not critical. Good bang for the buck. To get 5 stars, the printer would need to be faster, hold more paper and cost less for cartridge replacement. You just won't get that at this price range.

review/text: ... I haven't been disappointed! This is simply a great little printer. It's lightning-fast, very, very quiet, and doesn't complain a bit. I haven't had a single paper jam or other problem with it.The 940c has separate cartridges for black and for color, which is really great for someone who primarily prints out black and white documents. Further the print heads are within the cartridges themselves, so no more messing around trying to clean heads. This does mean, however, that one must align the heads every time one takes out or replaces the cartridges; fortunately, this is a relatively quick process with the included software.Photo quality is allegedly outstanding, but in all honesty, I haven't purchased any photo print paper yet to test this myself, and of course photos printed out on plain paper are completely sub-standard. Color documents look very nice on plain paper, though.Set-up was easy, although I did have a some kind of [glich] during the installation process, and couldn't print anything other than test pages - no other programs could print. I'm still not certain what happened, and reinstalling the software immediately took care of the problem. I haven't had any other problems since.Replacement cartridges are assuredly not cheap, in the grand old HP tradition, but for regular home use, this shouldn't be a huge burden.Overall, I'm very impressed with this little device, and would unreservedly recommend it for any home user.

I have a great deal of respect for HP. They have a plant in this area and I would love to work for them .........Over the years I have owned HP printer, exclusively. After my third HP printer just quit I became so frustrated and so disappointed that I switched to another brand. I figured I had little to lose so why not, it could only get better.I though the HP printed page was excellent but the quality of the printer was not. I know they make the money from the print heads not the printer, but what good are these expensive print heads without a relaible unit to run them in. In addition when I tried to inform HP about my problem customer service was not to be found. I tried the internet, phone search, the store I bought the printer at - no luck.Since I switched my printer brand, I have had no problem with my printer other then the massive amount of print heads I have to buy, yet I think most printers are ink hogs.Anyway, I think the quality of the HP printer is great but from my perspective not enough better then printer vendors to put up with the frustration. I will think twice about getting another HP printer.

Here's an update to the review I wrote three months ago. I'm still very happy with the printer. I have since moved it to a new PC, and downloaded and installed the updated version of the driver, and have had none of the driver problems (batch printing crashes, slow installation) that I had on my other PC with the older driver. It installs quickly and runs reliably in both Win98 and WinXP. Ink cartridge use strikes me as about average, compared to what I'm used to, *provided* that the printer is set in Windows to print in default in Economy mode. PC World, however, in the January 2002 issue and viewable at their website, rated ink costs for this printer on the high side (six cents per page for text, mode unspecified). Ink costs for other printers in their review ranged between two cents and seven cents per page for text. PC World rated its speed as average; it will feel fast (with USB and in Economy mode) to anyone buying a new printer for a reasonably new PC for the first time in at least two years, as I did.I am quite concerned, though, by the numerous reports in other reviews here of people who have had trouble with paper feeding with the 940c. I have had no trouble with that at all in my printer, but the number of problems reported suggest a possible design or quality control problem. This is particularly worrisome given the *much-too-short 90 day* warranty offered by HP.

This printer is awesome have had mine for over a year and i hate hp!! But this printer ROCKS!!!For all those that say the ink runs out and is too expensive... BUY THE LARGE INK TANKS... if your cheap at the counter and buy economy size your getting ripped you can buy the large size and double the ink for minimal extra.The tanks aren't refillable for very good reasons, like print quality. Speed is awesome try to print an 8X10 on a lexmark and you will find out that the lexmark is left behind and not as pretty.I'm an IT pro so i get to deal with trouble printers all the time and this one i NEVER see. The next best printer to this would be an epson.in the end the people who complain about this printer are probably trying to be cheap and save a buck by buying junk ink, or the economy taks and NON decent paper hence paper jams etc.Throw some nice injet paper or even standard xerox paper in it and get nice text... throw in some HP photo paper and get BEAUTIFUL photos up to 8X10.Closing words... VERY NICE!!

I'm having the same problem as Ennus from Seattle. When I have plain paper in the printer and printer properties set for plain paper the printer works fine. The trouble starts when I load photo paper (HP's own brand of premium photo paper glossy). I set the printer properties for hp premium photo paper. I use HP's photo imaging software that came with my HP digital camera. What happens is the pivot assembly arm in front of the paper feed mechanism does not retract as it does when I have the printer set up for plain paper. When the pivot assembly does not retract, the paper will jam against it as the paper feed mehanism continues to feed the paper causing ruined paper and a jamed up printer. HP's support has been slow to respond and of no help. The only way I can print a decent photo is to load only one piece of photo paper and as it starts to print and jam against the pivot assembly, pry up the paper with a pen. You have to do this quickly as there are six separate points that the paper jams against. I know this printer is prone to having a tab be incorrectly positioned causing jams as HP has a procedure on there site for repositioning the tab. That is not the problem I am having, as the tab is correctly positioned. If it were not for this feed problem,I would give the printer 3 to 4 stars,but of course this is not a minor problem.It is extremely aggravating.

Setup was easy enough, but this printer routinely goes haywire, spitting out a whole cartridge load of paper and refusing to print. I have tried it with several different PCs, with this same intermittent weird behavior. Only a reset of both the printerand the computer seem to fix everything.I'm off to buy an Epson!

While shopping for a new printer, I knew that image quality was very important to me. After reading some reviews of this printer, I learned that some people had problems with tram lines appearing on photo paper. That is a problem I have yet to see, and thus far I have been completely satisfied with this printer. The automatic paper type sensor is annoying at times, but it does what it is supposed to do. Also, having a "print cancel" button is something someone should have thought of about ten years ago, when printers were more prone to spit out random ASCII characters, but it is still a nice thing to have now.My only caveat about this product is the high price of ink, where a regular-sized black ink cartridge can cost [a lot], and a color one even more. I am willing to pay that since my last printer died because I had been using generic ink cartridges, but think about long-run costs if you plan on doing a lot of printing with this printer.

review/text: ...........~ ~ ~ ~ * * * * ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ When I was shopping for a new printer, I purposely looked for an HP. The Epson I was replacing had given me headaches from the start, with every thing from loading paper, to big lines across printed images. I had had good luck before with an HP series 500 DeskWriter that I used with my Mac.~ ~The first sign was not promising. I got an e-mail 1 day after my purchase notifying me of a safety recall. I could have screamed. But, as I read more carefully, I saw that all I had to do was see if the power cord was made by a certain subcontractor, and if so, get a free replacement.When I got the printer, yes, it was the faulty type, but I ordered the free replacement online and got it quickly.~ ~Since then, everything has been smooth sailing. Set up was very easy. Loading the software onto Windows 98 was easy. (I don't usually even try, I have my brother do it, but this looked like something I could handle myself). Loading paper was easy. Praise the Lord; no more paper jams!~ ~The disadvantage is that the printer is slow. Even just black and white text documents, and even using just draft quality. The advantage is that the print Quality is great. Even at normal, text documents are crisp and clear. Choosing &quot;best&quot; quality is great for sharp text on transparencies. But where it is really counts for me is on my cherished edited photographs. They are excellent quality.I definitely recommend this printer enthusiastically* * * *, unless you need fast print jobs.It's Outstanding for crisp, clear documents, and beautiful graphics, but it won't win any races.

I've had this printer for about a year. About every 3 months I need to change the color ink cartridge when I don't even use it. I've called support and they didn't help me at all. I changed the black ink and when I print something, nothing comes out on the paper. On the printer it shows 3 circles on top and 4 on the bottom. I can't keep buying color ink cartriges every 3 months. What do I need to do?

I've had this printer for nearly five years, and it's outstanding for printing text and general purpose printing, including envelopes. I've read some reviews of people having problems with paper feeds and envelopes, but I haven't had one problem yet. This printer has probably spit out about 10,000 pages, and I'm yet to have a problem, other than expensive ink.I'm really into photography, and I do not use this printer for that - I have a much more advanced printer for that purpose. It's fair to note that HP has a very good track record with photo printers, however. But, this printer has a three color cartridge, so it's not really well suited for printing more than the occasional print.Overall, this is a great printer that I'd recommend you pick up used if you are looking for a printer to run lots of text through. (I don't believe it's available new anymore.) It takes the widely available HP 45 Black and HP 78 color cartridges. One drawback - the ink is a bit on the pricey side - upward of $30 for the black, and slightly more for the color cartridge. I've tried using generic cartridges, and the print comes out jagged and not readable, so you're better off sticking with the genuine HP cartridges.HP has lived up to it's well-earned reputation of making solid printers with my HP 960. I won't replace it for printing out text until it dies, and then it will probably be another HP.

This printer worked like a champion. I retired it for a 2230 and later for a cp1700. I made countless prints off it. Never had it fail me, misfeed or so much as tell me no. I bought the duplexer and loved that thing too! I wish I had one for this CP1700. The ink prices and refilling the carts are the only complant I have. But it is what it is. All desktop printers are designed to make there bosses money. When you buy a printer you are buying a subscription to ink. Though compared to everything else on the market in it's class the 960 is the champion. If I had to estimate the page count I put on that little machine I'd have to say about 12,000 pages in color over a 1 year period, at least 1,000 pages per month. Most everything I print is full page color. It sucks that HP doesn't make them like the 900 series anymore.
