I recently bought this charger kit from Amazon and I am quite happy with my purchase .
The problem is the flip mechanism became loose , and any horizontal pressure would push the buttons back up .
24 hours of charging and the lights stay on .
The others that I looked at were larger .
There 's a lot of claims out there about what the best batteries and charger are .
The recharging process is less than 3 hours .
It is simple to use , just fold out the electric prongs and plug into a wall outlet or extension cord .
They paid the same or even more for their chargers too !

Hit q or quit to leave. Enter product ID: Reviewed quite a bit of the combo players and was hesitant due to unfavorable reviews and size of machines .
And setting the VCR timer is awkward -- you ca n't enter the start and end time but have to scroll -LRB- unless I 'm missing something -RRB- ... but those are my only complaints .
Finally , I was disappointed to learn that you can only record on the VCR in SP -LRB- 2 hr -RRB- or EP -LRB- 6 hour -RRB- speeds .
I love the style of this , but after a couple years , the DVD is giving me problems .
I bought this player when it first came out ; VHS combo players were brand new and seemed much more sensible than separate players .
JVC is the inventor of VHS vcr , and I have known people to have good luck with their electronics .

However , I made an actual recording on this unit from a satellite broadcast and the playback looked excellent .

Included in my e.mail was the following : `` While I find the overall TV to be good , I am appalled at thequality and functionality of the remote that operates and comes withthat particular model .
They look like top-of-the-line models when compared to this piece of crap.On top of not having the basic buttons , and amongst other issues , the remote is frustrating because : 1 .
Your comments and opinions are important to us .
I compared a few different flat panels with review before I narrowed down my pick , which ended up with the Sylvania as over well liked .
I have been a long time patron of Sylvania products because they have never let me down . .
Overall I would give it a 5 . .
The DVD did n't work at all .

Hit q or quit to leave. Enter product ID: I am fairly satisfied with the MusixStation .
Allows me to make the changes I want without having to go to the unit itself .
However , when the power supply is used with the MusixStation , it has no operational problems due to power consumption.DISPLAY : The LCD display is a little delicate but does the job .

The `` LOUD '' feature adds a decent punch , and the built in subwoofer is decent for a portable device , but certainly can not be compared to any `` real '' subwoofer or computer bass cube .
A Loudness button you select On or Off .
I would recommend this product .
Also , for its size , I thought it could be louder , but again , I do n't have much to compare to ... Radio : FM is not picked up very well , except for the strongest of signals .

Hit q or quit to leave. Enter product ID: The tripod is well built .
I bought this tripod for video tapping an upcomming family wedding and have tried it a couple of times to get used to it .
I then sling it with camera attached over my shoulder and walk to my next shoot.It is great to that you can turn off the power off to the camera , zoom , pan , record and even take stills during video taping , all without taking your hand off the tripod 's handle.I am using this tripod with a Sony HDR-HC7 High Def camcorder . .
I know its not a professional tripod , but it is silent .
Furthermore , if you open Sony 's description for the VCT-D680RM Remote Control Tripod , it directly lists the DSC-N2 as compatible.Note that the DSC-N2 is only HALF compatible .
When I received the box , it had an oppening , you could stick your hand inside !
Compatible with my Sony very well . .
I found this tripod on Sony 's website , but was a bit put off by the price , both there , and at Circuit City .

Second , while the built-in microphone is very sensitive at picking up voices and ambient sounds , it does not have a foam wind sock .
:-RRB- The TRV108 also includes a host of effects you can add to your video footage.One bad thing , though , is this model does not have the stabilizer .
Well , you will not be disappointed with this one !
I did n't expect it to keep up , but it did better than I expected .
I have been using it to tape track meets and everything can be seen clearly .
However , it had a problem which turned out to be a blessing in disguise .
We dont intend to use it on the computer so the analog camera is a better deal for us than digital . .

I bought this to protect my new 55 inch LG flat screen . .
I purchased this product because of this `` $ 25,000 '' equipment warranty .
I ca n't say the same for devices `` protected '' by other manufacturers surge and back-up systems .
I have purchased two for use in different locations .
Great value for a surge protector .
Great little item and great price . .
It 's about as small as it can get .

Hit q or quit to leave. Enter product ID: Hi.I got this camcorder few days before , and now using it daily almost 5 hours in day .
We went into our bathroom and turned out the lights , turned on `` night-shot '' and lo and behold we could see in the dark and record !!
The usb streaming feature is fun and easy to use and produces remakable images on your computer .
Works well with WinXP .
Dazzle only pushes video through the USB and uses your sound card to bring in sound .
I can go into a bathroom with all the lights off at 12 pm and turn on my night vision on my camcorder and find my little pee pee .
This is my second camcorder .
For instance , my computer , which is fairly fast would typically have very smooth recording , but every once in a while would skip a few frames , and I would then have to go back and edit it .

Hit q or quit to leave. Enter product ID: I recently purchased this camera and have been very pleased with its performance .
One extremly useful feature of this camera is the light , which really works well at night .
I was willing to drop $ 500 for a MiniDV because I wanted to easily edit my videos , but I was n't willing to spend another $ 500 to upgrade my PC to accomodate the large amounts of data.Otherwise , the Sony CCDTRV308 is a great Hi8 camcorder for basic video recording and little or no editing . .
About 30 minutes of shooting remained , even though we used the LCD the whole time.Title use is a little confusing , but you do get the option of creating two custom titles in addition to the standard fare.The tripod was prepared , just in case the weight of the camcorder became tiring , but it was not needed .
I highly reccomend this product to anyone looking for a top quality camera at an affordable price .
I have webtv so I can capture all of the stills I need and do it quite easily and without software and a computer.Keep it simple stan is definitly my mantra and this camcorder helps me do just that .
I also have lots of Hi8 video I shot while I was in the military that I want to transfer to DVD so after a lot of research chose the CCD-TRV308 .
If you plan on using it for extended periods of time you will probably find it bulky and heavy by today 's standards . .

Hit q or quit to leave. Enter product ID: Does just what was needed to charge the Macbook Pro G4 13inch laptop .
Lo compre con reservas , ya que una bater&iacute;a gen&eacute;rica que compr&eacute; a mi laptop termin&oacute; por derretirme el cablecito de mi cargador Mac original .
Although it says G4 Titanium powerbook , it seems to also work with the Aluminium powerbooks .
Pros : quick ship Cons : incorrect description , lack of durability .
so much more inexpensive than the apple adapter .
I am also going to notify Amazon to research this topic , and take the product off the site until they can resolve the issue .
and at half the cost that I paid for my LAST replacement power adapter -LRB- yes , I am on my THIRD -RRB- this is a bargain .
The cord is much longer than Apple 's charger and seems a lot more durable .
