Notes:



1. To compile and run Tagger.java, execute the following commands:

	javac -cp stanford-postagger-2015-01-30/stanford-postagger.jar Tagger.java
	java -cp ".:stanford-postagger-2015-01-30/stanford-postagger.jar" Tagger [inputfile]

***The Stanford POS Tagger package contains most of the code needed to run the Tagger.  In order to compile and run, my program needs the path to where to find the jar file that the POS Tagger is located on.  So wherever you load the tagger, make the path phrase correspond to where it's located.
